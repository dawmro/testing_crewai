Rising Of Tanaka In Another World
Written by Guri,
The Rising of Tanaka – 34 Part 2.

「Isn’t it plenty enough already? Isn’t it about time to practice performing the real deal… or something?」
As far as Tanaka was concerned, he was filled with the desire to try out performing Grand Magic as soon as possible. So, while suppressing his overflowing desire, he tried suggesting as such to Kaku-san, but….
「Let’s see, you may be right…. It may be about time to start putting it into practice.」
After thinking about it for a while, Kaku-san readily agreed. Never expecting to receive a green light from him so easily, even as he was in shock, Tanaka’s excitement flew through the roof at once at the same time.
「Shaaaa! I’m so excited… Kukuku, with this I’m finally stepping on the same stage to fight against the Gods, huh… It took such a long time. I have been able to do nothing but always stand on the receiving end, persisting against the predicaments that were shoved on me, but such days are finally about to turn into history. Finally, my lost power is about to be revived. Let’s once again raise the curtains of our battle against the Gods here. Fuhahahahahaha!」
Tanaka was so full of excitement that he had gone crazy. However, what he was saying wasn’t necessarily wrong, either. To fight against the administrators of the world such as Gods and spirits, ordinary humans were suffering from an overwhelming lack of firepower. To compensate for this, they had to rely on either divine artifact class equipment or the firepower of Grand Magic. In fact, battles between Gods and spirits were nothing but an exchange of Grand Magic. Thus, being able to perform Grand Magic could also be meant that you were stepping on the same stage as the Gods and spirits.
Well, it meant close to nothing in front of Tanaka’s absurd power, but as none of them was the wiser of this truth, it was only to be expected that he would be overcome with zeal in his Grand Magic training.
「Let’s do it! Focus, focus….」
Tanaka quickly struck a cool pose and began to focus himself in order to perform Grand Magic. The preparations to control and utilize the magical energy accumulated in the circuits inside of his body were already set.
「Kuh!」
Kaku-san involuntarily leaked out a grunt due to the pressure caused by the magical energy that was leaking out of Tanaka. Even Kaku-san, who was a spirit, couldn’t help but feel that this leaked power was boundlessly tremendous.
「The time has come… My ambition is hereby completed here… O peerless beauties, come forth! Harem Creation!!」
Declared Tanaka while raising his hand to the sky. Due to the sublimation of his magical energy, his body was covered in light. There, utilizing the Grand Magic, the power of miracle, peerless beauties… didn’t appear in front of him.
「… Huh?」
「You fool! Don’t give me this ‘huh?’! What the hell are you doing? Don’t start out with something so big out of the blue! You have to start with something small first!」
Uncharacteristically, Kaku-san let out a retort. Kaku-san was very strict when it came to magic. Tanaka took Kaku-san’s warning to heart and gave it another try.
「Let’s get ourselves together and give it another go!」
Tanaka once again struck a cool pose. Just like before, he was about to perform Grand Magic.
「The first step upon my ambitions…. Come forth. Little girl Creation!」
And then, the ensuing result was no different than before.
「Like I told you, why are you trying to perform such a big matter right off the bat? I told you to start with something small!」
「Didn’t I do exactly that just now?! I changed it to a little girl, didn’t I?!」
「That’s not the point! Creating a human being is a way too high of difficulty! In the first place, just what do you think the power of the administrators is? I’ve never heard of anyone pulling off miracles of such a level!」
「What the hell are you talking about? Unless through some miracle, there’s no way I could ever create myself a harem! … Ugh.」
Tanaka received mental damage due to his own words. Glittering sweats were involuntarily flowing out of his eyes.
「Even middle-aged men, you see. We also want to have an adventure, you know?! There are times when we do things we know they are wrong!」
「I don’t get what you’re talking about at all!」
Suke-san was busy practicing magic by himself, despite the commotion between the two.
「How peaceful-degozaru.」
Before him was the seventh-order magic, Windstorm, which was being controlled by him to shave the bumpy wasteland into a paved plot of land. In grace of Tanaka’s inexhaustible supply of magical energy, Suke-san, who thus could invoke magic incessantly as he pleased, was also steadily tearing apart the wall of common sense.
In such a way, team Tanaka was continuously growing diagonally upward as usual. They had been leading such a pleasant life, but no one had noticed that a new battle was about to engulf them within.
