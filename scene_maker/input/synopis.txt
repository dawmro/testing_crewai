Following story is fanfiction based on Overlord novel by Maruyama:
DMMO-RPG Yggdrasil was ending. Guild-master Momonga organizes one last get-together before servers shut down. Most of the old guild members didn't bother to respond, but some showed up in the last few days. One of them, Tabula Smaragdina, acted weirder than usual, then something unexpected happened. From players of a virtual reality game to Gods in a new world. Momonga and four of his friends might think that the world is just waiting for them to conquer it. But things are never as easy as they seem. The world is hiding many secrets and a game in which they and their enemies might be nothing more than pieces on a chess board.
