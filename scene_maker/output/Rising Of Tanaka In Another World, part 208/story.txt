Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 208.

The battle ends with Tanaka and the God of Creation descending to the ground, surrounded by Morinaga's apostles. Morinaga, severely injured, apologizes for her failure, while the God of Creation criticizes her incompetence.

Tanaka, noticing Morinaga's plight, expresses his desire to help despite not fully understanding the situation. The God of Creation dismisses her, leading to a moment where Tanaka's boldness shines as he intervenes to protect Morinaga.

The God of Creation attempts to seal Morinaga in a crystal to prolong her existence, but Tanaka seizes the opportunity to take custody of the crystal. He confidently declares his intention to revive and educate her, despite the God's objections.

Tanaka's antics amuse those around him, including Suke-san and Yashichi, who comment on his lively nature. Tanaka, however, is focused on the next stepâ€”restoring the damaged ceremonial hall and handling the aftermath of the battle.

Despite the God of Creation's warning, Tanaka rushes to the castle for an eagerly anticipated get-together event hosted by Echigoya. His determination to shine in this new world drives him forward, leaving others to ponder his motives.
