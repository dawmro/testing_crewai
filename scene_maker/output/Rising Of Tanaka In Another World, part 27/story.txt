Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 27.

In a quiet tavern at dusk, Tanaka vents his frustrations to the old man. He complains about his lack of success in hunting fire lizards despite weeks of effort, expressing his desire to see a 'dream' where he becomes strong.

Tanaka豪言that he doesn't need strength himself—he can hire it. He spends his money freely on drinks, celebrating his financial success from hunting fire lizards, while the old man looks on worriedly.

The next morning, Tanaka wakes up with a hangover and stays in bed, having overindulged the previous night. Meanwhile, at the guild, Echigoya reads through reports about the dragon slaying operation.

Echigoya contemplates the two major problems from the dragon incident: its unexpected transformation into a jet-black, stronger form, and its subsequent explosion. He theorizes that an external force might have caused the explosion.

Echigoya considers the possibility of someone intentionally manipulating events but dismisses Tanaka as a potential culprit. He decides to inform the world about the incident, focusing on immediate dangers while remaining uncertain.
