Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 83.

Tanaka arrives in the new world and encounters Shijimi, who introduces him to the horned tribe village. Shijimi offers hospitality, showing kindness despite Tanaka's initial awkwardness.

Murgai, the son of the clan patriarch, is reluctant to welcome humans into the village. He argues with Shijimi but eventually agrees to guide the visitors, much to Tanaka's internal frustration.

Tanaka subtly observes Murgai's resistance and decides to play along to avoid drawing attention. His plan is to stay under the radar while exploring his options in this new world.

Shijimi rushes off to meet Baron Almond, leaving Murgai and Tanaka behind. Murgai's irritation grows as he glares at Tanaka, who remains calm despite the tension.

Tanaka uses his charm and wit to gain Murgai's trust, offering advice on becoming popular. Despite Murgai's initial resistance, he slowly opens up to Tanaka's influence.

The chapter concludes with Tanaka staying at Murgai's house in the village, beginning his journey of healing mental scars and adapting to this new world while keeping a low profile.
