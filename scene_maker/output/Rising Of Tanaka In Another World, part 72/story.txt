Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 72.

Tanaka enters a tavern in Haburunayo and listens intently as the tavern owner describes the town's situation. He learns that the military has taken most of the skilled adventurers, leaving only E-ranked adventurers to handle threats.

Curryman, an A-ranker with twin swords, storms into the tavern in a rage. He orders a strong drink and vents his anger over being called 'Currypan,' a name he despises.

A drunkard approaches Curryman and compliments him on reducing monster damage, unknowingly referencing the wrong name. This enrages Curryman, who grabs the man by the lapels, ready to kill.

Tanaka steps in to stop Curryman, confident in his ability to handle E-ranked threats. He boldly intervenes, showing his resolve and cleverness despite his low rank.
