Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 175.

Tanaka and Yahichi reunite after years. Their old friendship reignites as they catch up on their lives, with Tanaka sharing his recent adventures in the new world.

Torte arrives on the scene, her tsundere personality shining through as she argues with Yahichi. Despite their bickering, there’s an underlying respect and camaraderie between them.

Yahichi explains the uneasy alliance between the nobles and hardline demons, hinting at a deeper conspiracy. Tanaka listens intently, his curiosity piqued by the mysterious developments.

Torte reveals her own suspicions about the Imperial Tournament Festival, suggesting that the nobles and demons have ulterior motives for opening it to demon participants. The group agrees that something feels off but lacks concrete evidence.

As the conversation turns serious, Tanaka’s trivial actions—like shaking his head to dispel a bad memory—amuse those around him. Despite the tension, there are moments of light-heartedness that highlight his character.

The group decides to investigate further, aware that time is running out and the stakes are rising. They part ways, each resolved to uncover the truth behind the Imperial Tournament Festival’s hidden secrets.
