Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 148.

Tanaka finds himself in a strange new world after being caught up as a bystander during the hero's summoning. He looks around in confusion and awe, realizing he has no choice but to adapt.

The warriors gather to face All Biter, a formidable demon. Mikoto and Curryman discuss Kamui's failed attack, highlighting the monster's resistance to physical damage.

Curryman confidently steps forward, suggesting they use magic to take down All Biter. The group discusses their limited magical abilities and the need for a coordinated strategy.

Kugel charges in with his sword, attempting to attack All Biter's wings. Despite his efforts, he finds it difficult to deal significant damage, as the demon regenerates quickly.

The group unleashes a series of fire-based magic attacks on All Biter, attempting to overwhelm it with flames. The demon's tentacles writhe in apparent agony, but its core remains unharmed.

Merlin warns the group about All Biter's regenerative abilities and flight membranes. Kugel suggests targeting its legs to ground it, while Tetsujin advises focusing on its wings.
