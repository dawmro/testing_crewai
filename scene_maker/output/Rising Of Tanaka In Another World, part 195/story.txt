Mikoto and Yashichi sense an unusual power surge at the ceremonial hall, hinting at the unraveling of a ancient seal. Their conversation reveals the long-lost history of the Demon Lord's battle against Morinaga and the subsequent sealing of his power.

Zonmer recounts the war between demons and humans that escalated into a global conflict. The Demon Lord sought help from Gods and spirits to confront Morinaga, leading to a devastating battle where both sides suffered immense losses.

Torte questions the morality of the war, while Mikoto expresses disdain for Morinaga's leadership. The Knight of Roses interjects with knowledge about the God of Creation's power, suggesting it could undo the seal and allow Morinaga to return.

Yashichi speculates on Morinaga's intentions and the chaos his resurgence would bring. The sky darkens, and everyone feels an impending disaster as the situation escalates.

Tanaka's satisfaction and Toby's irritation highlight the absurdity of the situation. As the emergency deepens, the story leaves viewers wondering how this chaotic turn will unfold next.
