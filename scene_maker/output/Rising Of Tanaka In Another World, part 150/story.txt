Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 150.

Mikoto and Merlin channel their divine power to unleash a devastating spell against Cassius. The barrier of highest-level magic collapses under the overwhelming force, leaving scorched ground in its wake.

Cassius' laughter echoes as All Biter's upper body emerges from the ground. Its eerie presence grows stronger, taunting the heroes with its godlike power.

Kamui raises his divine shield to protect Mikoto and Merlin from All Biter's advancing tentacles. The clash of light and darkness reveals Kamui's weakening resolve as he struggles to hold the monster at bay.

Cassius commands All Biter to strike again, unleashing a torrent of energy that engulfs Kamui. The ground shakes, and the air fills with dust as the hero fights to stay standing against this overwhelming force.
