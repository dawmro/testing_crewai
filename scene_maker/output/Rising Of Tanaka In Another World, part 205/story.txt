Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 205.

Morinaga is attacked by the Incarnation of Destruction, who pierces her with a black tentacle-like arm. The entity mocks her efforts to resist, revealing its intent to learn the secrets of Morinaga's barrier.

Toby Saar, empowered by the cursed sword Scream Vaster, attempts to intervene but is easily overpowered by the Incarnation. His attack on its arm is rendered ineffective, and the entity continues its assault on Morinaga.

The Incarnation of Destruction discovers the cursed sword's power when it touches Scream Vaster. It realizes the danger posed by this weapon, leading to a tense standoff where the entity attempts to destroy the sword but is intrigued by its potential.

Toby, overwhelmed and despairing, is about to be killed by the Incarnation. However, it stops when it detects a strange tool within his pocketâ€”a small fighter named Rikishi. The entity destroys Rikishi but fails to kill Toby, leaving him in a state of grief.

Tanaka suddenly appears from nowhere, delivering a powerful punch to the Incarnation of Destruction's gut. The attack stuns the entity, allowing Toby and the others to escape. Tanaka's arrival marks a turning point in the battle, showcasing his mysterious abilities and saving Toby.
