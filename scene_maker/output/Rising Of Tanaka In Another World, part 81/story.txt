The wastelands stretch endlessly, dotted with small towns and villages. Kamui's team travels westward, their mission to investigate abnormalities near the border. The group is on high alert, their previous defeat still fresh in their minds.

Kamui's companions, Kaltovich, Tetsujin, and others, are shown battling a Sandworm. The creature's immense size and ferocity contrast with the team's earlier confidence, revealing their weakened state.

Mikoto observes Kamui's team from a distance, her expression filled with concern. She recalls the devastating defeat Kamui's party suffered, which has left them all in a somber mood. Kaltovich's usual flirting is absent, and Tetsujin remainsExpressionless.

Merlin and Mikoto discuss potential solutions to their困境. Merlin mentions the Witch of Abyss as a possible ally, though he expresses uncertainty about her true nature and intentions. The conversation hints at the larger threat they face.
