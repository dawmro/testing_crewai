Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 184.

The chapter opens with a tense battle in the sky, where two monsters are freely flying, engaging in intense combat. The Incarnation of Destruction taunts Tanaka, who remains cautious and evasive.

Tanaka attempts to attack the Incarnation of Destruction with his Meteor Fall spell, but it proves ineffective as the large stones vanish upon contact.

In a surprise move, Tanaka unleashes a powerful divine blade imbued with the power of God, managing to bisect the Incarnation of Destruction. However, the attack is short-lived and leaves him vulnerable.

Tanaka adopts a new strategy, using large stones as cover to avoid detection while he conceals himself and awaits an opportunity for another surprise attack.

The Incarnation of Destruction creates a semi-transparent shield, countering Tanaka's surprise attack. The two forces clash, resulting in a spectacular display of light and energy.

Tanaka declares his next move, showcasing his unique magical ability—The Great Sins Triad Annihilation Formation—and delivers an unexpected and creative finishing blow with 'Leg cramp!'
