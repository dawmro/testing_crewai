Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 79.

Kamui collapses after receiving a severe injury, his life hanging in the balance as Kaltovich rushes to treat him with healing magic.

Tetsujin struggles valiantly against the encroaching darkness, firing desperate attacks and using her Combustion magic to buy time for her companions.

Kamui awakens, urging Kaltovich to focus on supporting Tetsujin and authorizing himself to continue his own healing despite Kaltovich's concern.

Kaltovich invokes her strongest secret magic, 'Light-Logia-Crash!', creating a shrine of light that temporarily repels the enemy with overwhelming power.

Tetsujin alerts the group to prepare for escape as the enemy demonstrates an unimaginable ability, isolating and dispelling Kaltovich's third-order magic, leaving them in awe of their opponent's strength.
