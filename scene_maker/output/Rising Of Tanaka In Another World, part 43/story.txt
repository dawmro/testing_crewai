Despite the chaos, Brutus decides to send all remaining dragons to distract the monsters while retreating the troops. This buys them time to escape, though it comes at great cost.

Tanaka and his team, Suke-san and Kaku-san, celebrate their success in slaying many dragons. Tanaka dances on a dragon corpse, showing his joy and greed for the materials they have acquired.

A Western National Alliance Colonel arrives to thank Tanaka's team for saving her troops. This encounter sets the stage for potential future interactions with other factions in the world.
