Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 10.

Tanaka arrives at the guild building in Hazama town, marveling at its size and grandeur. He steps inside, expecting a bustling environment but finds it eerily quiet.

At the reception desk, Tanaka interacts with a tired-looking woman who explains the guild's functions and the current situation in town due to the recent hero summoning incident.

Tanaka registers as a guild member and learns about job requests, guild ranks, and promotions. He is at rank E and eager to start his new life in this world.

Intrigued by the receptionist's mention of rare black horned rabbits, Tanaka reveals he has several carcasses. The staff is astonished at the sheer number and quality of his materials.

Tanaka sells all his black horned rabbit materials for a significant sum, totaling over 1.5 million gold pieces. He then inquires about a good inn to stay at and departs the guild.

After securing a room at an inn for a month, Tanaka reflects on his new life in the other world, feeling both exhausted and hopeful as he drifts into sleep.
