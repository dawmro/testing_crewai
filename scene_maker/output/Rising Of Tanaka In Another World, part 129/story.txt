Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 129.

Tanaka stands confidently, striking a cool pose as he engages in conversation with Nawasuki. He challenges her to surrender, showing his determination to win over not just the battle but also his enemy.

Nawasuki, unimpressed by Tanaka's boldness, commands her three demons to attack. However, Tanaka uses a snap of his fingers to bury the demons waist-deep in the ground, showcasing his unexpected power and kindness.

Nawasuki is shocked by Tanaka's ability but quickly regains composure. She flicks her whip at him, only for it to be deflected by his cursed sword, Death Abiagette, creating a powerful windstorm that overwhelms her.

Curryman watches the battle with growing admiration. He is awed by Tanaka's power and decides to follow him, inspired by his strength and ideals of reaching greater heights.

The chapter ends with Nawasuki realizing her ambitions have been dashed. Cornered and overwhelmed by Tanaka's overwhelming power, she curses her lack of luck in facing the strongest man she has ever encountered.
