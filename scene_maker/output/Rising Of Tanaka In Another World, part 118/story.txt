Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 118.

The sacred mountain of Chocoboro is depicted in ruins. The White Wolf Tribe, led by Black Mikeneko, flees as the Purin Kingdom army attacks their village, leaving destruction and death in their wake.

Black Mikeneko buries his family's remains, overwhelmed by grief. Tanaka watches silently from a distance, moved by the somber moment.

Tanaka approaches Black Mikeneko with an offer to help bury the dead, initiating a tentative bond between them despite initial awkwardness.

Tanaka pulls out an extensive array of items from his magical storage. He sets up a campfire and begins cooking a lavish feast, surprising Black Mikeneko with his generosity.

The two share a meal together, with Tanaka's enthusiasm for life rubbing off on Black Mikeneko. They discuss the 'Promised Land,' reigniting hope in Black Mikeneko's heart.
