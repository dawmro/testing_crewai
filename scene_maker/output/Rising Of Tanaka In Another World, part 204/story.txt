Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 204.

The three heroes—Kaku-san, Mikoto, and Yashichi—observe the intense battle between Suke-san and the Incarnation of Destruction from afar. Kaku-san explains the dire situation as the God of Creation foresees Suke-san's imminent defeat.

Kaku-san reluctantly reveals that their trump card, 'Neo Muscle Rainbow,' is their only hope. Despite not mastering it fully, they decide to use it to turn the tide of the battle.

Suke-san and Kaku-san unleash their combined power in a multicolored energy attack, but the Incarnation of Destruction shrugs it off effortlessly. The heroes realize the futility of their efforts.

In a desperate bid for victory, Suke-san and Kaku-san channel all their strength into 'Evil Crushing Fist Ascension – Rising Sun,' creating a massive fist of light that engulfs the Incarnation of Destruction. The attack succeeds in destroying it.

Despite their victory, Suke-san and Kaku-san are left exhausted. The God of Creation praises their effort, but Mikoto senses something amiss—the Incarnation of Destruction's presence lingers.

Yashichi recalls Tanaka's prediction that the Incarnation would return, and indeed, it does. The heroes brace themselves for another battle, realizing they may need to face this threat repeatedly.
