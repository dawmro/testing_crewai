Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 9.

Tanaka approaches Hazama Town, a small settlement surrounded by forests and simple defensive structures. He looks around curiously as he nears the entrance gate.

The gatekeeper Hachi confronts Tanaka in a casual yet authoritative manner, initiating an inspection. Tanaka remains polite but finds the process anticlimactic compared to his expectations.

Hachi explains his duties and introduces himself as Antoninus VIII, or Hachi for short. He also mentions his partner Trajan IX, known as Kuma. Tanaka finds the naming tradition amusing but keeps his comments respectful.

Kuma, a large and imposing figure, is introduced by Hachi. Despite his size, Kuma appears mild-mannered. Tanaka apologizes for his earlier remark about the family names, showing his quick wit and ability to adapt.

Hachi directs Tanaka to the guild building, which is much larger than expected. Tanaka expresses hope for exciting new experiences in this new town as he heads towards the guild.
