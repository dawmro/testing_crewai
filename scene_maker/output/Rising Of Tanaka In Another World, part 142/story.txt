Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 142.

Tanaka and his companions arrive at the volcano to summon Uesama. They discuss the dangers of descending into the crater.

The group attempts to call out Uesama but faces difficulties, leading to a humorous exchange between Tanaka, Kaku-san, and Suke-san.

Tanaka devises a plan to create an air membrane to protect himself from the heat. He successfully casts live-support magic, creating a path into the crater.

The group descends into the crater using the air membrane. They encounter intense heat but manage to survive due to Tanaka's magic.

Tanaka and his companions reach the bottom of the crater, where they encounter En'ou Zonmer, a powerful supernatural entity made of flames. The confrontation begins as the group faces their next challenge.
