Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 36.

Tanaka meets a dying spirit woman who explains her plight. Her core has been destroyed by a lance strike, leaving her with little time left.

Tanaka uses his mana transfer ability to heal the woman's wound, only for it to temporarily close before widening again, showcasing his limited power.

The woman entrusts Tanaka with protecting her child and disappears, leaving behind a floating light that becomes Kaku-san.

Kaku-san, a muscle-bound spirit, appears and causes chaos. Tanaka is overwhelmed by his appearance but quickly decides to confront the situation, leading to their journey ahead.
