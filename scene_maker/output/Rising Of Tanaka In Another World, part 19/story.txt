Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 19.

Tanaka arrives in Hinoki City and explores the bustling downtown area. He makes cautious observations about his surroundings and humorously remarks about the absence of 'plumber with a mustache' mushroom specialists.

Tanaka visits the guild in Hinoki City to seek information about magic tool shops. While waiting in line, he overhears a conversation between guild members discussing the difficulty of finding a large magic crystal.

After asking questions at the guild, Tanaka learns more about magic crystals and their rarity. He decides to visit a magic tool shop but finds most items familiar and mundane compared to what he encountered in his previous town.

Tanaka bumps into a scholarly-looking man named Omoi while exploring the magic tool shop. The two strike up a conversation, with Tanaka making light of Omoi's fragile appearance and sharing his own experiences as an E-ranked adventurer.

Tanaka and Omoi discuss their shared interest in magic crystals and agricultural challenges. Omoi reveals his expertise in agriculture and explains the ongoing issues with magical energy in the ground, which has impacted farming efforts.
