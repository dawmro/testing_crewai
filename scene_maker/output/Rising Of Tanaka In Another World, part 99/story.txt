Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 99.

Tanaka stands in the bustling streets of Ketavanagh O, his mind filled with thoughts of power and manipulation. He smirks to himself, fully embracing his 'evil charisma' as he walks past.

The camera pans over the city's skyline, highlighting its decadence and wealth. The state-run casino gleams in the center, a symbol of the city's opulence and vice.

Inside the casino, General Red sits confidently, surrounded by beautiful women. His table is set with cards, and the tension is palpable as he awaits Toby Saar's arrival.

Toby, pale and nervous, enters the room. General Red greets him with a cruel smile, outlining the stakes of their upcoming game: his life.

The poker game begins. General Red taunts Toby, revealing his cards one by one. The rules are explained in detail, setting the stage for a high-stakes showdown. Toby struggles to keep his composure as he realizes the hopelessness of his situation.
