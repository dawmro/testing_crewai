Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 124.

Tanaka finds himself in a tavern, where he meets Eclair, a beautiful woman who becomes curious about his knowledge. He tries to maintain his prestige by giving vague answers about his background.

The conversation turns to the rumors of the Demon Lord, with the tavern old man providing details about the mysterious figure. Tanaka listens intently, trying to hide his envy and fascination with the idea of being a powerful ruler.

When the Hero is mentioned, Tanaka reacts strongly, cheering on the Demon Lord in an attempt to distance himself from his own insecurities about facing the Hero. Eclair notices his strange behavior but chooses not to confront him directly.

Tanaka's attempts to flirt with Eclair are awkward and half-hearted, as he struggles to balance his desire for her attention with his fear of revealing his true nature. The tavern old man looks on with skepticism, unsure if Tanaka is as knowledgeable as he claims.

Despite the lack of concrete information about the Demon Lord, Tanaka manages to keep Eclair's spirits up by emphasizing the value of patience and persistence. His internal monologue reveals his true feelings of fear and admiration for the mysterious figure.

Tanaka decides it's time to leave the tavern, offering to escort Eclair home under the pretense of heading in that direction himself. Eclair hesitates but ultimately agrees, leaving Tanaka grinning internally at his successful manipulation.
