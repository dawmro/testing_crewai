Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 17.

Tanaka encounters three bandits who confront him, warning him about their superior skills and power. He tries to stall for time while assessing his situation.

The bandits attack Tanaka simultaneously, showcasing their refined swordsmanship. Despite being overwhelmed, Tanaka manages to defend himself with his crude yet determined movements.

Tanaka realizes the bandits are not真正的高手 and taunts them, pointing out their lack of skill and suggesting they register as proper adventurers. This infuriates them further.

The bandits, now in a frenzy, attack Tanaka with brute force. Their erratic movements create an opening, which Tanaka exploits to break free from their grasp.

Tanaka's sword breaks under the pressure of the bandits' relentless attacks. He realizes the futility of his situation and screams in frustration.

The bandits, confident in their victory, close in on Tanaka. However, mysterious holes appear on their abdomens, causing them to collapse instantly. Tanaka stands victorious but confused by the events.
