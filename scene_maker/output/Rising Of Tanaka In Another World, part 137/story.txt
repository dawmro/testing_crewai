Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 137.

Orangetto, the youngest Black Demon brother, notices an unusual movement in the distance while serving as the lookout for their camp. He alerts the group about potential danger approaching from the south.

The group realizes they are being targeted by a cavalry unit of kingdom soldiers. The soldiers' advanced formation and superior tactics put the demons at a significant disadvantage, both in terms of quality and quantity.

Curryman and Kugel discuss their dire situation but remain determined to fight. Despite being outnumbered, they decide to take action and delay the advancing forces by heading towards the mountain ranges for a strategic advantage.

The group prepares for battle, with Curryman leading the charge and Kugel coordinating the efforts. They instruct their allies to move quickly and find a suitable location in the mountains to ambush the cavalry unit.
