Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 151.

The heroes, including Curryman, Kugel, Tetsujin, and Kamui, struggle against a powerful monster with overwhelming tentacles. Despite their efforts, they find it difficult to make progress.

Kugel saves Kamui from certain death by grabbing the huge mouth of the tentacle, but his actions raise questions about his motives. Kugel explains that his body moved on its own, leaving everyone puzzled.

The monster overcomes the heroes with overwhelming power, transforming its tentacles into sharp blades and attacking them. Kugel continues to resist, even as he is pierced by multiple tentacles.

As Kugel weakens, the monster prepares to devour everyone. However, it suddenly vanishes due to an explosion caused by a mysterious objectâ€”a gigantic sword that pierces the ground, emitting ominous power.

Curryman and Tetsujin express frustration and confusion about what just happened. Meanwhile, Cassius-slash-All Biter appears, challenging Tanaka-san to a confrontation in the sky.

Tanaka-san arrives, floating in the blue sky as a jet-black man. Despite his unconventional appearance and mannerisms, he is determined to resolve the situation, even if it means confronting social issues like employment problems and inequality.
