Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 46.

Tanaka and his team set out towards the Republic’s capital, aiming to gather information about the Torochi royal family. Suke-san and Kaku-san, being too eye-catching, are instructed to stay outside of towns while Tanaka infiltrates them alone.

Tanaka visits numerous taverns and theaters in his quest for information. His sharp movements and dexterity improve as he engages in activities like admiring female students at schools and cheering for his favorite actresses in theater performances.

After completing the first volume of the Republic Beauty List, Tanaka feels a sense of accomplishment. His team decides to return to the Haru Empire with a light heart, having spent their time in fulfilling daily activities.

The Republican army, following Cassius’ orders, avoids confronting the Alliance army directly and instead harasses them with small skirmishes. This tactic stalls the Alliance army’s advance, allowing the Republicans to prepare for a final battle at the Ninoude Cloister.

Cassius observes the battlefield with satisfaction, having prepared a summoning ritual involving Brutus and the magic tool of servitude. He expresses his enjoyment of the situation while anticipating the upcoming clash against his own siblings.

The Alliance army, despite suffering losses from dragon attacks, absorbs reinforcements and resumes their march towards the Republican lines. The Republican army, numbering only 15,000, waits in ordered lines for the enemy’s arrival.

When the Alliance army arrives at the battlefield, the Republican Army launches its attack, signaling the beginning of the final battle. The stage is set for a clash that will determine the outcome of the war.
