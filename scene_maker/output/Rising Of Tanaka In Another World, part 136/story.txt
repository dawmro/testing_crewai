Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 136.

Tanaka and his companions discuss their route through the rugged mountain range, considering the risks of facing powerful monsters. They debate whether to seek help from Uesama and whether it's wise to involve everyone.

The group learns about Uesama, a monstrous entity that can provide safe passage through the volcanic area in exchange for consulting with it. They decide to proceed cautiously, understanding the potential dangers ahead.

Tanaka expresses his eagerness to meet Uesama while the group prepares for their journey. Despite concerns about the long time since any information was received about Uesama, they remain determined.

The trio, including Curryman and the Black Demon brothers, departs towards the volcano. They are seen off by their allies, who express anxiety but trust in their ability to succeed.

As they journey north, scouts from the Purin Kingdom Army observe them. The scouts report back, setting up potential future interactions and challenges as Tanaka's group approaches the volcano.
