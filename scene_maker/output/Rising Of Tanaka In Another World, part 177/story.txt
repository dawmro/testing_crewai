Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 177.

Tanaka arrives at Oedo Castle, admiring its grandeur. He mentally prepares himself for the infiltration, recalling past events and the importance of this mission.

With a confident smile, Tanaka activates his levitation magic and ascends to the roof of the castle, ready to make his move. His mediocre stats don't phase him as he prepares for the infiltration.

Tanaka leaps from the roof, using his levitation technique to float through the air with ease. His plan to crash through the roof is executed flawlessly, despite his initial doubts about his abilities.

Upon landing inside the castle, Tanaka encounters a mysterious black-haired woman wielding a thin sword. She questions him, and he attempts to charm her with his infamous 'Osare skill,' but it has no effect.

The woman attacks Tanaka, nearly delivering the fatal blow. In a split second, Tanaka dodges her strike and devises a quick escape plan, using his magic to create a hidden passage through the walls.

Tanaka escapes through the newly created passage, narrowly avoiding detection. He reflects on his actions, realizing how close he came to certain death and marveling at his own survival instincts.
