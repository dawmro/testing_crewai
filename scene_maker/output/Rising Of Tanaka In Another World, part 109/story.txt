Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 109.

Yashichi demonstrates his superior combat skills, moving at an accelerated pace that confuses the kingdom soldiers. His martial arts techniques are flawless, and he takes down enemies with ease, leaving everyone in awe.

Tanaka hands Toby a普通剑 (ordinary sword), but it's no ordinary weapon. It radiates an overwhelming magical presence, revealing its true identity as the cursed sword 'Scream Vaster.' The sword's power transforms Toby, giving him incredible strength.

Toby awakens to his new power and begins to fight off the kingdom soldiers. His movements become fluid and precise, cutting through enemies with ease as he gains confidence in his abilities.

The kingdom soldiers, despite their numbers, are no match for Toby's newfound strength. He dances through the battlefield, dispatching enemies left and right, but the relentless pressure from the soldiers continues to mount.

A group of magic squad members unleashes a concentrated fire of attack magic at Toby, creating a massive explosion that engulfs the area. However, as the dust settles, it reveals an invisible defense wall created by Tanaka's support magic, protecting Toby from further harm.

Yashichi intervenes and takes down the remaining magic squad members with incredible speed and strength. His hero powers shine as he delivers a swift and decisive victory, leaving no chance for resistance.

Tanaka remains in a safe position, using his strategic mind to support Yashichi and Toby from afar. His presence is a testament to his determination and belief in their cause, as he avoids direct confrontation despite the chaos around him.

With most of the magic squad eliminated and the remaining soldiers defeated, Yashichi and Toby prepare for their escape. The victory is hard-won, but they know it's time to leave the battlefield behind and move on to new challenges.
