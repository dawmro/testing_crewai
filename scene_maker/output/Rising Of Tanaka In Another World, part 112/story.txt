Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 112.

The grotesque monster, All Biter, appears with the body of a dragon fused with a giant's torso and tentacles. Its unsettling presence terrifies even the kingdomâ€™s soldiers.

Tanaka notices Angel Caramel's remains attached to All Biter's head, recognizing her distinctive features despite their grotesque state.

All Biter attacks Tanaka with its massive fist, creating a small crater. Tanaka dodges gracefully and devises a plan to rescue Angel Caramel, seeing hope in his magic's potential.

Tanaka attempts to sever All Biter's torso but is met with regenerating tentacles that fuse back together, proving the monster's infinite regenerative power.

Cassius mocks Tanaka and reveals his madness, explaining All Biter as a divine experiment. He manipulates General Red into aiding him, leading to the soldiers' demise.

General Red orders Cassius to stop the monster but is swiftly devoured by All Biter's tentacles, leaving Tanaka as the lone survivor of the massacre.

Tanaka retreats strategically, recognizing the futility of fighting All Biter alone. His departure mirrors the wisdom he's gleaned from anime and games, ensuring a future victory.
