Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 55.

Tanaka presents his power-up plan to Suke-san and Kaku-san at the Gokuri pavilion. He explains his strategy for enhancing their abilities through training and magic support.

Suke-san undergoes intensive magic training, receiving mana transfers from Tanaka and Kaku-san to strengthen his skills. His magical energy capacity grows significantly as he practices relentlessly.

Kaku-san focuses on mastering magic control, a challenging path that mirrors Tanaka's past experiences. Despite his human appearance, Kaku-san improves steadily with the support of Tanaka’s magical link.

Tanaka learns Chanting Omission, allowing him to invoke magic without traditional incantations. He plans to replace the standard chants with his own cool and unique phrases, enhancing his harem goals.

Tanaka discovers Multiple Chanting, enabling him to cast multiple spells simultaneously. Despite the reduced firepower, he sees this as a perfect complement to his Chanting Omission technique for achieving his ambitious goals.

The team’s progress is showcased as they move beyond the world’s standard power levels. Tanaka contemplates his next steps, aiming to master the new techniques and achieve his ultimate ambitions.
