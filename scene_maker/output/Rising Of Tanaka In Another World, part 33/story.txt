Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 33.

Tanaka gathers information about suitable caves for magic training in Nanashi town, consulting with locals at the tavern and guild.

Tanaka and Suke-san depart for the northern monster territory, hunting monsters to level up Suke-san before reaching their destination.

Upon arriving at a rocky area, Tanaka and Suke-san explore and locate a cave, which becomes their training ground.

Tanaka excitedly begins his magic training, confidently declaring his intention to create new spells. He successfully casts Stone ball, sending a massive boulder into the cave with a轰鸣声echoing through the area.

Suke-san expresses shock and amazement at Tanaka's spell, while Tanaka humbly admits to his lack of control, leading to further brainstorming on improvements.

Tanaka envisions enhancing Stone ball by making it smaller, faster, and adding fire attributes. He plans meticulous adjustments for safety and versatility.

Tanaka hands Suke-san a magic book, encouraging him to learn new spells alongside his existing Ignition and Water skills. Suke-san contracts Airflow and Embankment magic.

Tanaka continues intense training with Stone ball, destroying caves one after another while Suke-san experiments with his new magic nearby.

On a restless day, Tanaka notices Suke-san attentively watching him. Frustrated by the distraction, Tanaka humorously hints for Suke-san to find something else to do.
