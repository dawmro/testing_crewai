Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 67.

Suke-san notices a disturbance in the distance, with wagons and numerous people gathered. He comments on the seriousness of the situation, hinting at an impending event.

Tanaka internally rejoices upon spotting the merchant raid event, seeing it as his chance for success. Despite his trembling body from excitement, he suppresses his urge to rush and devises a strategy.

Kaku-san questions Tanaka's decision to handle the event alone, given Team Tanakaâ€™s principle of safety. However, seeing Tanaka's matured demeanor, they decide to support him.

Tanaka confidently approaches the scene, ready to act. A bandit leader confronts the group, but Tanaka's sudden appearance disrupts the tension with a dramatic entrance, saving them from harm.

Realizing his earlier mistake in direction, Tanaka adjusts quickly, pointing out the correct spot for help. His quick wit and confidence impress everyone present.

Despite his best efforts, Tanaka misses an opportunity to interact with a harem member he had hoped to meet. Frustrated, he clenches the soil in disappointment, highlighting his human side.
