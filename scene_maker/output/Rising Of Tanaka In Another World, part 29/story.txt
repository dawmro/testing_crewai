Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 29.

Tanaka arrives in the northern town with Echigoya. The town is lively with non-human creatures wandering around. Echigoya explains that demons, once a powerful race, were driven to the north after their defeat and now work for the Empire's development projects.

Echigoya reveals the pragmatic truth behind the Empire's decision to hire demons. Tanaka admires the Empire's generosity initially but later feels let down by the reality of their motives. Echigoya suggests they discuss plans at the guild, and Tanaka agrees.

Tanaka and Echigoya decide to split up: Echigoya will stay in the northern town to finish works, while Tanaka heads to Nanashi town ahead of him. On his way, Tanaka hears a dispute and rushes to investigate, expecting a typical hero's scenario but finds himself face-to-face with a winged beauty and a skeleton.
