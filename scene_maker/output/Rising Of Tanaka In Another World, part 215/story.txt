The Skekaku duo gathers Tanaka's friends in the wasteland. Kaku-san and Curryman exchange concerns about their missing leader. The conversation shifts to speculation about the sudden gathering and the potential threat they face.

Hero Yashichi and Hero Kamui express growing tension as they discuss their lack of preparation for an unexpected battle. Toby and Éclair exchange worried glances, while Ganash mocks their fears, typical of his quarrelsome nature. The heroes' usual dynamics are on full display.

The world is suddenly enveloped in a powerful pressure as Kaku-san casts a defense-type support magic. Zonmer explains that the townspeople have likely fainted due to the battle's intensity, leaving only those with strong hero bloodlines conscious.

The ground trembles as the Incarnation of Destruction emerges, larger than previous encounters. The Incarnation declares its intent to destroy the world and confronts the heroes, who brace themselves for battle under Zonmer's leadership.

Zonmer telepathically communicates the importance of surviving the battle to prevent global destruction. Ganash and Éclair prepare for combat, with Ganash expressing his determination to fight despite the odds. The heroes adopt a defensive stance as tension builds.

The ground collapses in an eruption, revealing the Incarnation of Destruction. Kaku-san and Zonmer discuss the gravity of the situation, while Hero Yashichi unsheathes his sword and takes a combat-ready stance. The heroes remain vigilant as the tremors intensify.

The Incarnation of Destruction confronts the heroes, declaring its intent to destroy them before moving on to the rest of the world. Ganash taunts the Incarnation, while Zonmer urges the team to focus on survival rather than victory. The battle begins with the heroes in a precarious position.

In the void of nothingness, the God of Creation and the God of Destruction clash in an annihilation battle. Their energy collisions grow increasingly intense, with the God of Destruction initially gaining the upper hand. However, the God of Creation's purity and determination turn the tide as the Incarnation of Destruction is overwhelmed.

The God of Creation declares that he will no longer show mercy to the God of Destruction, having learned from past mistakes. The battle becomes one-sided as the God of Destruction's energy diminishes rapidly under the overwhelming power of the God of Creation.

The Incarnation of Destruction expresses disbelief at its impending defeat, while the God of Creation asserts his resolve to annihilate it. A final, intense glow signals the end of the battle as the God of Creation emerges victorious, leaving the world safe from destruction.
