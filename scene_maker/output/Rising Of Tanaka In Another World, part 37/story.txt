Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 37.

Tanaka and his companions arrive in Nanashi town, finding it eerily quiet with only scattered signs of life. The once-bustling streets are now deserted, leaving the group to ponder the strange absence of enemies.

Echigoya, a key figure in the town, greets Tanaka and his companions with a mix of curiosity and authority. He quickly dismisses their delayed return, focusing instead on the urgent need to rebuild the town after the recent attack.

Tanaka struggles to explain the events that led to the fall of the beautiful woman-spirit, resorting to vague excuses. Echigoya listens with growing suspicion but remains preoccupied with the town's recovery efforts.

The group decides to help rebuild the town, starting with the local inn. Along the way, Kaku-san's bizarre appearance and human form become a point of contention, as Tanaka questions the practicality of his speedo-clad appearance.

Kaku-san defends his appearance, citing the instruction of his master to be 'beautiful.' The conversation shifts to his magical abilities and how they might benefit the group in future battles. Tanaka expresses interest but remains skeptical.
