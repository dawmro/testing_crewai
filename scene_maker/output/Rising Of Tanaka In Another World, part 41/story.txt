Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 41.

The General and Brutus stand on an observation platform, watching in shock as a massive tornado suddenly appears and destroys the Republican Army's central forces. The General expresses confusion while Brutus recognizes the power of the magic involved.

Brutus explains to the General that the magic used by the mysterious monsters matches the descriptions of high-order magic from ancient legends. She suggests sending dragons to confront them, despite knowing it may be insufficient.

Tanaka and his companions are traveling away from the scene when Kaku-san senses an approaching dragon. Tanaka is initially excited but quickly realizes the danger as the dragon begins attacking with its breath.

Kaku-san transforms to avoid the dragon's attacks, while Suke-san struggles to find a way to counter it. Tanaka decides to use his own magic, summoning stone balls to fight back against the dragon.

Tanaka's stone balls hit the dragon, causing explosions that weaken it. Despite the dragon's efforts to escape, Tanaka continues his relentless assault until he finally defeats it with a powerful 'Dimension Shattering Explosion Wave.'

After defeating the dragon, Tanaka and Suke-san share a conversation about the rules of society. Kaku-san humorously expresses concern about his crew cut hairline, adding a light-hearted moment to the tense situation.
