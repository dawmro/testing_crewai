Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 34.

Tanaka excitedly flips through his magic book, searching for the right spell. He finds 'Mana Transfer,' an eighth-order magic, and decides to prioritize improving his magic skills over other training.

Tanaka confidently casts Stone balls repeatedly, enjoying the process and feeling a surge of energy. Suke-san watches in amazement as Tanaka's magical prowess grows rapidly.

After three days of intense training, Tanaka's magic skill improves dramatically. He contracts 'Mana Transfer' and 'Accel,' preparing to test the former with Suke-san's assistance.

Tanaka successfully casts 'Mana Transfer,' transferring magical energy to Suke-san, who recovers immediately but is slightly surprised by the impact. Tanaka notices his own magical energy remains unchanged, puzzling him.

Tanaka resumes training, focusing on controlling Stone balls and occasionally transferring magic to Suke-san. The duo adapts their training routine, incorporating new strategies and tactics.

After a week of rigorous training, Tanaka completes his new Stone ball magic. Suke-san learns ninth-order magic, and the two devise creative combat tactics, using 'Accel' to enhance their skills.

The pair prepares to depart for their next mission, with Tanaka reflecting on his progress and looking forward to new challenges. Suke-san stands ready by his side, a powerful ally in this magical world.
