Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 218.

Tanaka arrives in the new world, curious and determined to enjoy his time despite his mundane stats. He encounters the God of Destruction, who launches an energy beam aimed at destroying the world. Tanaka narrowly escapes unscathed as the attack mysteriously dissipates.

The God of Destruction, baffled by the failed attack, unleashes another powerful beam. This time, Tanaka mocks him, suggesting that his attacks are ineffectual and will only harm himself. The god, furious, continues his assault but finds that each attack backfires.

Tanaka explains that he exists in a higher dimension, making the god's attacks futile. He taunts the god with riddles and provocations, challenging him to transcend dimensions. The god, unable to comprehend this new reality, grows increasingly frustrated.

Despite the god's relentless attacks, Tanaka remains unharmed. He reveals his understanding of causality and existence, arguing that the god's arrogance prevents him from transcending dimensions. The god, left speechless, realizes he is powerless against this mysterious force.

The chapter concludes with Tanaka standing victorious, having outsmarted the God of Destruction through logic and principle rather than brute power. The god's defeat marks a turning point in the story as Tanaka's unique abilities become more apparent.
