Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 182.

The Incarnation of Destruction confronts Tanaka, taunting him with its overwhelming presence. Tanaka remains unfazed, determined to escape the Imperial Capital.

Tanaka hastily uses Levitation magic to flee, driven by memories of Toby and Éclair's fear of divine power. He rushes towards distant skies away from human life.

The Incarnation of Destruction pursues Tanaka with terrifying speed, its numerous arms closing in to capture him. The battle begins with both sides evading each other's attacks.

As the fight intensifies, Tanaka taps into his hidden power source—24 hamsters that symbolize his growth and strength. They work tirelessly to sustain his magic, while the original hamster analyzes the battle's outcome.

Tanaka, desperate to end the chase, unleashes a powerful Meteor Fall spell. Large stones rain down on the entity, but it remains unharmed and continues its pursuit undeterred.
