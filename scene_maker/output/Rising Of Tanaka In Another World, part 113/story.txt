Tanaka arrives at a small farming village and spots a merchant's tent in the center square. He approaches the merchant, seeking a weapon.

The merchant invites Tanaka into his tent, revealing crates of weapons. The merchant explains he comes from the Haru Empire and has traveled extensively.

Tanaka's attention is drawn to a massive sword leaning against the crates. It captivates him with its ornate guard and pommel, igniting his excitement.
