Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 30.

Tanaka arrives in the new world, dumbfounded by the sight of a skeleton speaking in a samurai-like tone and a winged beauty chasing after it. He stands frozen, overwhelmed by the strange encounter.

The skeleton approaches Tanaka, calling out for help. The winged beauty follows closely, her sword at the ready. Tanaka is panic-stricken as he tries to make sense of the situation and decides to mediate despite his fear.

The winged beauty attacks Tanaka, forcing him to pull out his sword and defend himself. The skeleton takes cover behind Tanaka, using him as a shield. Tanaka protests but continues to fend off the attacks while trying to reason with the winged beauty.

Tanaka, overwhelmed by the chaos, involuntarily summons a massive wave of water to distract the winged beauty. The three characters are swept away by the torrent, and when they resurface, Tanaka names the skeleton Suke.

Despite his confusion about being named 'Suke,' the skeleton seems content with its new name. Tanaka, now partnered with Suke, decides to head north towards Nanashi town, beginning their journey together.
