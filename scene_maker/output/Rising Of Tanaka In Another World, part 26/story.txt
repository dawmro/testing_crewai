Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 26.

Tanaka finds himself facing a D-ranked monster, which he initially dismisses as weak. However, the encounter quickly turns dire as fire lizards emerge, surrounding him.

Desperate to escape, Tanaka activates his secret technique 'Suicide Water,' creating a massive flood that sweeps him away. Despite this, he finds himself surrounded by even more fire lizards upon resurfacing.

Tanaka fights valiantly with his sword and magic, managing to kill several fire lizards. However, the number of enemies only grows, putting him in a perilous situation.

With no other options, Tanaka resolves to use his forbidden magic. He casts 'Stone Ball,' summoning a massive rock that carves a path through the lizards, allowing him to retreat into the mountains.

After escaping, Tanaka returns to town and notices the acquisition of a new skill: Dragon Slayer. He reflects on how he obtained it and the challenges it presents for further growth.

Tanaka becomes excited about his new skill but quickly realizes the difficulties in improving it. Despite this, he resolves to embrace his ' chuunibyou' spirit and seek out more dragon-related adventures.
