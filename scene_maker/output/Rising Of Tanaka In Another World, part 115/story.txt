Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 115.

Team Tanaka stands at the entrance of sacred mountain Chocoboro. The forest looks serene but eerie, with towering trees and vibrant greenery.

Tanaka and his team venture into the forest, enjoying its tranquility until they hear disturbing sounds of bloodcurdle in the distance.

The team discovers a gruesome sceneâ€”mutilated soldiers with torn armor scattered around. The forest floor is drenched in blood, creating a chilling atmosphere.

A white werewolf emerges from the bushes, its eyes filled with malevolence. It pounces on Tanaka, intent on attacking him with sharp nails and fangs.
