Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 85.

Murgai begins his patrol duty, accompanied by Team Tanaka. The village is quiet, but tensions are high as they prepare for potential dangers.

As the team navigates the forest, a sudden tremor signals the arrival of a massive creatureâ€”a Dragon Turtle, the most powerful monster in the region. Murgai is terrified but determined to protect his village.

Tanaka and his team spring into action, attacking the Dragon Turtle with precision and skill. Suke-san's scythe slashes immobilize its limbs, while Kaku-san's barrage of rocks shatters its shell. The battle is over in mere seconds.

Murgai watches in disbelief as Team Tanaka defeats the Dragon Turtle effortlessly. He climbs onto the creature's corpse, overwhelmed by the unexpected victory and the strength of his new allies.
