Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 45.

The scene opens on a grand pavilion in the capital of the Republic of Gokuri. Inside, the nation's top leaders from the nine cities are gathered for an emergency meeting. The atmosphere is tense as they discuss the monster threat in Tenohira Plains.

Cassius, director of the research institute, stands confidently before the assembly. He explains how their dragons, meant to fight rebel armies, were destroyed by the monsters. His tone suggests hidden knowledge and a dangerous plan.

As Cassius reveals that they have researched hero summoning rituals and developed a new one to create an even more powerful being, skepticism and fear grip the room. One representative questions the feasibility of this approach.

Cassius's eerie smile grows as he proposes sacrificing soldiers to gather magical energy for summoning the Evil God. The representatives are horrified but intrigued by his boldness and desperation.

The discussion becomes heated, with Cassius justifying their plan by emphasizing the greater good of saving the Republic. He suggests moving the front lines to Ninoude Cloister for the ritual. The leaders are silent, contemplating his proposal.

The meeting concludes with reluctant approval from the upper echelons. Cassius leaves with a nasty smile, while the others ponder the heavy decision ahead. The camera closes on the pavilion as tension builds for the impending ritual.
