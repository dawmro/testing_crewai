Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 7.

Tanaka encounters a mysterious puppy-like monster blocking his path. Despite its harmless appearance, Tanaka suspects it might be a powerful 'Boss' class creature due to his overactive imagination influenced by anime and games. He cautiously tries to outsmart the creature, eventually managing to slip away.

Tanaka successfully avoids detection by the monster and continues his journey eastward through the grasslands. His cowardly nature leads him to avoid towns and villages, opting instead to detour through a dense forest. Deep within the forest, he faces another sudden threatâ€”a black shadow that attacks him unexpectedly. Tanaka manages to fend it off with his limited skills.
