Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 11.

Tanaka successfully hunts a horned rabbit and stores it in his item box, displaying his cautious yet methodical approach to monster subjugation.

Over the past month, Tanaka has consistently accepted requests to subjugate horned rabbits, ensuring safety while systematically investigating other E-ranked monsters' battle powers.

Excited by his findings, Tanaka contemplates expanding his repertoire beyond monster subjugation and delves into the prospect of learning magic, a lifelong dream come true.

At the guild, Tanaka inquires about learning magic from Jody, discovering that his large item box capacity is unusual but unrelated to magical abilities.

Tanaka visits the magic tool shop, where he purchases a magic book and contract papers, beginning his journey into understanding and practicing magic.

Back at his inn, Tanaka studies the magic book, learning about the fundamentals of magic orders and preparing to embark on his magical training.
