Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 35.

Tanaka and Suke-san observe the chaos unfolding in the town from a distance. They notice mysterious shadows attacking the town and prepare to investigate.

The two identify the attackers as the beautiful women who previously targeted Suke-san. They realize the situation is more serious than they initially thought.

Tanaka and Suke-san encounter two beautiful women in the town, one with a red bodysuit and lance, the other wearing a pure white robe. Tensions rise as the winged woman accuses the robed woman of protecting 'heretic humans' and monsters.

The winged woman strikes down the robed woman with her lance, seemingly defeating her. Tanaka rushes to aid the fallen woman but discovers her wound emits light instead of blood, leading to an unexpected turn of events.
