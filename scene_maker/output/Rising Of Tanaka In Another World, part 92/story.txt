Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 92.

Team Tanaka arrives at the edge of the sealed valley, a fog-shrouded basin surrounded by cliffs. They discuss the barriers erected around the valley and the rumors of phantom beasts within.

Kaku-san explains the three layers of barriers in detail: one that disguises the area, another that distorts perception, and a third that traps anyone inside. He expresses pride in his creation while Suke-san listens with interest.

Tanaka, sweating nervously, questions Kaku-san about their purpose in the valley. He reveals his disdain for the weaker enemies they are about to face and contemplates the futility of their mission.

Tanaka shares his philosophy about seeking absolute strength to oppose the world's corrective power. He fears that becoming stronger within the barrier might lead to being noticed by the world again, endangering themselves and others.

Despite Kaku-san and Suke-san expressing surprise at Tanaka's reasoning, they agree to cancel the venture. However, as they debate their next move, a sudden gust of wind sweeps them off their feet, dragging them into the barrier.
