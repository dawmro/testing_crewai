Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 12.

Tanaka stands at the edge of the forest, determined to practice magic. He selects Ignition as his first spell, recalling the instructions from a magical tome. As he chants the incantation and gestures dramatically, azure flames erupt from his fingertip, causing trees to vanish and smoke to rise.

After struggling with Ignition, Tanaka attempts Water magic. A massive wave of water appears, overwhelming the forest and submerging Tanaka completely. He coughs and struggles to stay afloat, realizing the immense danger of his actions. The scene captures his frustration and growing fear of magic's unpredictability.

Tanaka reviews his stats and magical energy, discovering that no energy was depleted despite his powerful spells. He concludes that his lack of control is the root cause of the problem. The scene shows him frustration as he tries to understand why his efforts aren't improving his magic use.

Hachi, a familiar character, approaches Tanaka at the town entrance with news of a mysterious blue pillar of flame and ground rumbling in the forest. Sensing impending danger, Tanaka decides to flee the town to avoid trouble, highlighting his cautious yet无奈 attitude towards his new reality.
