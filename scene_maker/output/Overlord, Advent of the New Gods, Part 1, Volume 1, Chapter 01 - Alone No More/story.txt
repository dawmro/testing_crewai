In the final days before the shutdown of Yggdrasil, Momonga, the last member of his guild Ainz Ooal Gown, reflects on the game's decline and reconnects with old friends. He visits his NPCs and explores his guild base, only to be pleasantly surprised by Peroroncino's return. The chapter also introduces Bukubukuchagama joining a new clan and her interactions with Momonga.

Suzuki returns home from work, mentally exhausted. He secures his apartment, removes his protective gear, and prepares for a meager meal. Despite the harsh reality, he finds solace in logging into Yggdrasil.

Momonga logs into Yggdrasil as Ainz Ooal Gown, an overpowered necromancer. He visits his guild base, Nazarick, and interacts with its guardians like Albedo and Shalltear. The silence of the empty guild reflects his isolation.

Momonga checks the UI panels and notices Peroroncino has logged in. Their reunion is heartfelt as they catch up on life, highlighting Peroroncino's struggles with his sister Bukubukuchagama's health.

Bukubukuchagama joins Peroroncino's clan after a chaotic apartment scene. She meets Momonga and tries to break his social barriers, hinting at a possible friendship or support system.
