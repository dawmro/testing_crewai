Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 104.

Tanaka finds himself in an underground prison, chatting with Hero Yashichi, who is also imprisoned despite his divine protection.

Hero Yashichi explains the prison's magical patterns that suppress their powers and block magic activation, leaving them vulnerable.

Tanaka and Toby realize the gravity of their situation as they learn they cannot use items or tools due to the suppression field.

Toby panics, fearing their execution, while Tanaka remains calm, suggesting they rely on their wits to survive.
