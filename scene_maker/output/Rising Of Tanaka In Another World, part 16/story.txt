Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 16.

Tanaka receives an emergency request from Jody at the guild. He expresses his desire to start farming after completing the request, but Jody dismisses him with a stern warning about potential danger.

Tanaka’s inner fears and doubts are revealed as he prepares for the trip. His conversation with Jody highlights his nervousness about encountering bandits and his reluctance to face them.

Tanaka meets Echigoya, a young merchant who seems overly cheerful despite the bandit threat. Their interaction reveals Echigoya’s confidence and Tanaka’s skepticism about him.

The journey begins smoothly, but Tanaka feels uneasy. His conversation with Echigoya humorously contrasts their different perspectives on life and goals.

Tanaka takes charge of preparing camp while the group travels. His reliance on his item box to provide meals and bedding showcases his practical skills, despite his modest abilities.

While gathering firewood in the forest, Tanaka encounters three large-built men who unsheath their swords and prepare for battle. This marks Tanaka’s first life-and-death encounter with humans in this new world.
