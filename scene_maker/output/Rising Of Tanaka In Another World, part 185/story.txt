Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 185.

Tanaka activates his 'Great Sins Triad Annihilation Formation', summoning three hamster-like figures to battle the incarnation of Destruction. The formation creates a barrier, protecting Tanaka from direct attacks.

The hamster figures demonstrate their full potential, performing automatic defense and utilizing Grand Magic under Tanaka's instructions. They act as his alter egos, taking on the brunt of the battle while he spectates from a safe distance.

The incarnation of Destruction attempts to overwhelm Tanaka with its power, but the barrier of the 'Great Sins Triad Annihilation Formation' holds firm. The hamster figures reflect and nullify the destructive energy, showcasing their effectiveness.

Tanaka unleashes his full magical potential, channeling negative energy accumulated from Mondays into a devastating attack. The manifestation of this energy results in the destruction of the incarnation of Destruction and its barrier.

The battle concludes with Tanaka's victory. He mocks the defeated entity, confident in his ability to destroy it repeatedly with his completed formation. The scene ends with him departing exhilaratedly, imagining a future surrounded by beautiful women.
