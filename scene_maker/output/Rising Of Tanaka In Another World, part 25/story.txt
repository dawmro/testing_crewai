Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 25.

The dragon subjugation group retreats through rugged terrain, harassed by a relentless jet-black dragon. Homura analyzes their dire situation and considers the high risk of continuing the retreat.

Two magicians cast Ice Storm to halt the dragon's advance but are killed when the dragon charges forward, its power overwhelming even in the blizzard.

Homura faces certain death as the dragon prepares to strike. Just then, Tanaka appears, saving her and delivering a decisive blow that destroys the dragon in an unexpected manner.

Tanaka navigates the forest, cautious of monsters and attempting to find his way back to civilization. He encounters and defeats a Fire Lizard, showcasing his resourcefulness despite his average stats.
