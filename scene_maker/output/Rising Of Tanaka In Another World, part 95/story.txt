Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 95.

Beatrice appears before Tanaka, introducing herself and questioning his strange magical abilities. She explains that he has awoken the God of Creation's power.

Beatrice recounts the creation of the world by Umus, the God of Creation, who was forced to assimilate into the world to protect it from Kyou, the God of Destruction. This created a barrier that sealed Kyou away.

Beatrice explains the roles of various beings in the world: apostles manage it, humans bring new blood from other worlds, and she herself is the witch of the abyss, tasked with producing a new guardian if needed.
