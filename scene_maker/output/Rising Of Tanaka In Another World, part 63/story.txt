Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 63.

Tanaka, a普通上班族, finds himself summoned to another world. Despite his mediocre stats and unremarkable skills, he decides to embrace the adventure and declares, 'Since I'm here, I want to use magic!'

The fall of Majide Fortress sends shockwaves through the Western National Alliance. Diplomats and military officers gather at Gokuri to discuss对策, with Aisa, Shosa, and Taisa leading the efforts to strengthen defenses against the advancing monster swarm.

As tensions rise, the Purin Kingdom's army begins marching westward, raising suspicions among the Alliance. Aisa suggests a connection between the fortress' fall and Cassius' disappearance, hinting at a larger conspiracy involving jet black dragons.

The Alliance headquarters receives alarming reports about Majide Fortress and its surrounding regions vanishing into an endless cliff. This mysterious event leaves the Alliance army stunned and forces them to investigate the bizarre phenomenon.

Shosa and Taisa lead the Alliance army to the scene of Majide's disappearance, discovering a gaping wide hole and realizing the threat was not just monsters but a carefully orchestrated trap by Cassius' forces, now part of the Purin Kingdom army.
