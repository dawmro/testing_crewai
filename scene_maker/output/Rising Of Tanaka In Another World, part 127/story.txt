Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 127.

Tanaka expresses his deep-seated frustration with the world's ability to constantly dash his hopes. He reflects on past opportunities that slipped away, leaving him feeling worn out and defeated.

The trio travels back to Haru Empire, where Tanaka reveals his innermost thoughts about missing the Empire and his fabricated promise of finding a beautiful woman upon return. His companions, Kaku-san and another, humor him but sense his underlying melancholy.

Tanaka's companions try to lighten his mood with talk of specialty foods and the transit town, but Tanaka remains uninterested. He voices his desire for a beautiful companion or even a harem, showcasing his greedy yet endearing personality.

As they travel, Tanaka reveals his darker thoughts about fleeing from the kingdom and heading straight home, despite having no real 'home.' His companions find this amusing, highlighting his peculiar yet relatable character traits.

The trio senses a powerful presence in the forest. Kaku-san detects signs of battle, while Tanaka initially dismisses it as irrelevant to their journey. However, his curiosity is piqued when Kaku mentions the Forest tribe and their beauty.
