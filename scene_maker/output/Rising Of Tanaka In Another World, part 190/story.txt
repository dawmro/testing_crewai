Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 190.

Ganash descends from the ceremonial hall to the arena, surrounded by silent spectators. He carelessly discards Imperial Princess Karin and declares the Empire's fall, offering leniency to humans while challenging any demons present to challenge him.

Torte and Yashichi discuss Ganash's power and influence, with Torte revealing that his tribe was once dying but revitalized under his leadership. Yashichi expresses anger at Ganash's treatment of Karin.

Uesama, a superior spirit transformed into an objet d’art on Mikoto’s shoulder, speaks up with manly defiance, surprising the knight of Roses and prompting Nikumen to give him a thumbs-up.

Princess Lala of the Purin Kingdom watches the event from a dignitary's seat, reflecting on the Empire's fall. Hero Kamui, present as an escort, shows little reaction but hints at growing tensions with the Kingdom.

Torte warns her companions about the gravity of the situation while Éclair admires Uesama. Lala distances herself from Kamui, reflecting broader political and personal strains between the Hero and the Kingdom.
