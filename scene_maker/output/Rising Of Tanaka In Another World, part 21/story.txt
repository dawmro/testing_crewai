Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 21.

Tanaka returns to Hazama Town after casually hunting monsters on his way. He visits the guild to complete his usual request and is surprised when Jody informs him about a designated request from Echigoya.

Jody reveals that Tanaka was once called the 'Rabbit Slayer,' which angers him. He insists he has made peace with rabbits and refuses to harm them again, leading to a humorous exchange about his nickname.

Tanaka debates whether to accept Echigoya's request but is tempted by the promise of rewards. Jody hints at a hot spring resort near Nishi town frequented by young women, but Tanaka resists the诱惑.

Despite his initial refusal, Tanaka's sense of justice and desire to help others prevails. He decides to assist Echigoya and leaves for Nishi town the same day, traveling faster than expected due to his cheerful demeanor.

Tanaka arrives in Nishi town two days later and visits the guild to meet Echigoya. Echigoya explains that Tanaka's job is to hunt monsters around the town, not to slay a dragon as initially feared.

Tanaka begins his new assignment, starting with an easy first day of monster hunting. He returns to the inn satisfied, having ensured a safe start to his mission.
