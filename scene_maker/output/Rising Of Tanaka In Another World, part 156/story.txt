Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 156.

Tanaka arrives in Nanashi town with a group of over a thousand demons. Echigoya, the merchant and semi-ruler of the town, is overwhelmed but manages to greet them. Tanaka’s confident and smug demeanor catches everyone’s attention.

Tanaka stands in the center of Nanashi town, looking at the job agency with a mix of excitement and determination. He plans to use his stats as a trump card to impress everyone and start his journey as a protagonist.

Tanaka’s plan is derailed when Hero-chan and other powerful beings arrive in town. Everyone’s attention shifts to them, leaving Tanaka feeling sidelined and frustrated.

Tanaka secludes himself but quickly realizes he can’t afford to stay down. He begins to formulate a new plan to overcome the setback and regain his confidence.

Despite the challenges, Tanaka remains determined. He mutters about how irritating it is that Hero-chan overshadowed him but vows to come back stronger and not let such opportunities slip away again.
