Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 91.

Team Tanaka flies eastward at a low altitude to train Suke-san's flight abilities. As they approach Mount Poterongo, they notice an unusual black fog at the mountain's base.

The team realizes the 'black fog' is actually a flock of Haichou monster birds. The birds attack them en masse, driven by territorial instincts. Tanaka recalls his traumatic miso soup incident and fights valiantly.

Suke-san and Kaku-san support each other during the battle. Suke-san wields his scythe while Kaku-san provides spiritual guidance, avoiding friendly fire. Tanaka's enthusiastic 'Hoachou!' yell results in one bird being defeated.

Despite the overwhelming numbers, Team Tanaka manages to defeat all the Haichou birds. Suke-san and Kaku-san express relief and satisfaction with their performance, while Tanaka remains unsatisfied with his current power level.

Tanaka's internal struggle is revealed as he fears losing his vitality to the hero. He hides his anxiety behind a cool exterior, declaring his determination to seek more power. The team discusses their future goals, with Kaku-san cautioning against excessive ambition.
