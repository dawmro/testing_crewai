Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 119.

Tanaka wakes up sneezing like a certain brand of soft drink, finding himself on a sacred mountain with a nearly extinguished bonfire. He stretches and notices the absence of his companions.

The trio hears the howl of Black Mikeneko, who is in distress while picking up firewood to keep the bonfire alive. Kaku-san senses human soldiers nearby.

Tanaka and his companions rush to find Black Mikeneko mortally wounded by kingdom soldiers. Kaku-san casts a powerful restraining magic, Shackle of Mountain and Water, overwhelming the soldiers.

Black Mikeneko, weakened but still dangerous, is restrained by the magic. The kingdom soldiers, led by a powerful Purinist priest, are unable to defeat him due to the trio's intervention.

Tanaka tries to heal Black Mikeneko but fails as the latter clings to him with his last strength. Black Mikeneko reveals a dying wish to rest near his family and comrades, burdened by memories he had forgotten.
