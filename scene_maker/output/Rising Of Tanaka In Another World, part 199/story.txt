Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 199.

Morinaga observes Tanaka from afar, intrigued by his ability to block a powerful attack meant for eliminating a superior spirit. She underestimates him, thinking he is an easy target.

Tanaka confidently approaches Morinaga, asking for a lap pillow to ease his nausea from his earlier battle. His lighthearted request catches her off guard, leading her to believe he is mocking her.

Morinaga unleashes a sub-light speed energy attack on Tanaka, who counters it with a table tennis shakehand racket. His choice of weapon, influenced by admiration for his schoolmates, leads to a comedic yet dangerous situation.

Tanaka's return ball hits Morinaga directly, causing her to recoil and rethink her assumptions about him. This moment marks the turning point in their battle.

Ganash and Torte watch the unfolding battle from below, realizing the scale of Tanaka's power far exceeds what they can handle. They acknowledge his strength with a mix of fear and awe.

Ã‰clair focuses on the great demons in the distance, using her barrier technique to prevent harm from spreading. Meanwhile, Yashichi and others trustingly watch Tanaka's fight, confident in his abilities.

Morinaga prepares an even more powerful attack, determined to eliminate Tanaka. The destruction sphere she unleashes threatens the very existence of the Empire, showcasing the escalating stakes of their battle.
