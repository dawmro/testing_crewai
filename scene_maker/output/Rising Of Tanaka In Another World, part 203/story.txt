Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 203.

Kamui, Yashichi, and Mikoto face off against the Incarnation of Destruction, using their combined powers to create a divine shield and protect Morinaga. Despite their efforts, the pressure from the enemy's power begins to weaken them.

The Tavern old man, in his temporary God of Creation form, arrives on the scene to support Tanaka's comrades. He reveals that he sneaked into the tournament festival and was caught up in the chaos, unable to use his full powers due to certain restrictions.

Suke-san and Kaku-san confront the Incarnation of Destruction, with Suke-san engaging in a fierce battle while Kaku-san utilizes the power supplied by Tanaka to create an aura that neutralizes the enemy's influence. The Tavern old man watches the battle from a distance, offering encouragement.

The heroes gather around as the Tavern old man explains his presence and Tanaka's current state. Despite the initial confusion and shock, they find relief in knowing that Tanaka is safe and well.

The battle reaches its climax as Suke-san faces off against the Incarnation of Destruction, with Kaku-san's power keeping him sustained. The Tavern old man watches proudly as his comrades fight, while Tanaka relaxes with his hamsters, oblivious to the chaos around him.
