Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 5.

Tanaka learns of his powerless status and feels overwhelmed by the reality of being stuck in another world. He meets the General who explains the situation, highlighting Tanaka's lack of options.

Tanaka expresses a desire to return home, but the General dismisses this idea, explaining that no Hero has ever returned and that staying in the country would lead to imprisonment or worse.

The General provides a detailed explanation of the world's structure, including the division between the monster world (north) and the human world (south), as well as the geopolitical landscape of neighboring countries like Gokuri and Haru Empire.

Tanaka realizes his only viable option is to flee to Haru Empire, despite the challenges. The General offers assistance, providing him with new clothes and an item box for storing his old belongings. Tanaka begins to prepare for his journey, determined to make the best of his situation.
