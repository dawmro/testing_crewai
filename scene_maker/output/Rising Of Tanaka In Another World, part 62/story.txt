Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 62.

The battlefield is set as Angel Caramel channels the divine lance, her power glowing intensely. She confronts Tanaka, who counters with his own magic, Ignition.

As their powers clash, the ground trembles and the air crackles with energy. Both combatants demonstrate extraordinary strength, drawing the attention of onlookers.

Kaku-san notices an unusual surge in Tanaka's power, prompting him to revert to his human form. He expresses concern and prepares for potential danger.

Suke-san joins the fray, her support magic amplified by Kaku-san's enhanced abilities. Together, they flee the battlefield as the clash intensifies.

Tanaka's hidden power awakens, overwhelming even Angel Caramel's divine might. He taunts his opponent, confident in his newfound strength.

The battle reaches its peak as the divine lance shatters and Angel Caramel loses consciousness. The resulting explosion annihilates Majide Fortress and its surroundings.

In the aftermath, a blinding light engulfs the area, symbolizing Tanaka's mastery over his power and the conclusive destruction of the fortress.
