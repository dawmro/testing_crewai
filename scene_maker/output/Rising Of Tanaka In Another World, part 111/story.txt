The battlefield is eerily quiet as Tanaka stands confidently, his presence intimidating General Red and Warden Muchisuki. The tension builds as the two sides prepare for battle.

Warden Muchisuki returns with his pets, Dlime and Dlime, eager to fight Tanaka again. He vows to defeat Tanaka this time, determined not to repeat past mistakes.

Tanaka faces the approaching Dlimes with a confident smile. He unleashes a powerful attack of condensed magical energy, easily bisecting both monsters and leaving everyone stunned.

General Red is furious at the sight of his pets' defeat, while Warden Muchisuki screams in frustration. The scene shifts to Cassius, who remains calm despite the chaos, expressing admiration for Tanaka's power.

Cassius reveals his true intentions and the extent of his hatred for the 'evil god'. He unveils a new creation, a staff of domination, which captures Tanaka's attention with its unusual design.

The ground shakes as a massive monster emerges, tearing through the battlefield. The scene ends with the appearance of this terrifying creature, signaling the beginning of a new and more intense conflict.
