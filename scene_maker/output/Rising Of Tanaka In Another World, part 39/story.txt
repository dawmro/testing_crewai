Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 39.

The Republic of Gokuri, once a thriving nation, finds itself embroiled in civil war. The disappearance of magical energy weakens the national army's strength, leading to defeats and internal strife. City-states form an alliance, challenging the central authority.

General and Brutus prepare for battle at Tenohira Plains. The Republican army, despite being outnumbered, fights with high mobility and advanced magic tools. The war reaches a stalemate, showcasing their resilience against overwhelming odds.

The General orders Brutus to deploy the Republic's secret weapon: a flock of jet-black dragons. These dragons unleash devastating breath attacks on the Alliance armies, turning the tide in favor of the Republic and displaying the power of their new magic tool.

As the dragons annihilate the Alliance forces, mysterious figures appear on the battlefield. A figure in black robes with a scythe, a muscular man in speedos, and an ordinary middle-aged man emerge, signaling a new phase of conflict that will reshape the fate of Gokuri.
