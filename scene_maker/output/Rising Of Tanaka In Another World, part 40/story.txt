Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 40.

The Transfer magic subsides, revealing a group of soldiers surrounding Tanaka and his companions. Tanaka expresses discomfort and anxiety at the sudden attention.

Suke-san charges forward with acceleration magic to defuse the tense situation, drawing the soldiers' focus as Kaku-san prepares to provide support from above.

Kaku-san unleashes a powerful Windstorm magic, creating a tornado that dismantles the encircling soldiers and clears a path for escape. The trio witnesses the chaotic destruction caused by the spell.

The aftermath of the tornado leaves the battlefield in ruins, with Tanaka expressing shock and regret at the devastation caused by Kaku-san's magic. The group debates their next move.

Tanaka confronts Kaku-san about the excessive use of magic, leading to an argument about control and responsibility. Suke-san intervenes to bring them back to reality.

Suke-san advises retreat, and the group decides to head towards a less populated area despite their precarious situation. They disappear into the chaos, leaving destruction behind.
