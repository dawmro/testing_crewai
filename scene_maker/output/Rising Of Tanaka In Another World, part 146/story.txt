Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 146.

Kaltovich leads her elite unit into battle against the demon forces. The kingdom army struggles to gain the upper hand, and Kaltovich begins to question the lack of support from their commander.

Cassius appears suddenly, introducing his monstrous alter ego. His tentacle-like arms attack kingdom soldiers indiscriminately, causing chaos on the battlefield. Kaltovich watches in horror as her troops are overwhelmed by this new threat.

Cassius targets Kaltovich directly, ensnaring her with his tentacles and delivering a fatal wound. Kamui, driven by loyalty to the kingdom, rushes to her aid despite the ongoing battle with Mikoto and the hero party.
