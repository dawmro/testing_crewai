Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 24.

The subjugation group, led by Currypan, arrives at the mountain ranges and scouts the area where the dragon is rumored to be. They discover a cave believed to be the dragon's lair and finalize their plan.

The group attacks the dragon, using fireballs and ice magic to lure it out and disable its wings. The battle goes smoothly as they target the dragon's mobility.

Suddenly, the dragon stops attacking, lets out a roar of agony, and its body turns jet black. This transformation drastically increases its power, making it unrecognizable from before.

Currypan confronts the transformed dragon head-on but is swiftly defeated by its overwhelming speed and strength. The group retreats in panic as the dragon begins to chase them.
