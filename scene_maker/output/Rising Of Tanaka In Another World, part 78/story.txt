Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 78.

Tanaka finds himself in a bustling town filled with the sounds of merchants and adventurers. He is overwhelmed by the sights and sounds of this new world but remains curious and determined to make the best of his situation.

Tanaka stumbles upon Kamui, the hero of the Purin Kingdom, who is accompanied by Kaltovich and Tetsujin. Kamui explains the current situation in the kingdom and their mission to deal with a group of mysterious monsters.

The party travels through the wastelands near Haburnayo, encountering strange creatures and ancient ruins. Tanaka admires the beauty of the new world but remains cautious of the dangers lurking around them.

As they venture deeper into the wastelands, the group spots two figures in the distance: a massive, muscle-bound man wearing only black underpants and a skeleton clad in a black robe. The tension rises as they prepare for battle.

Tetsujin senses an overwhelming magical energy emanating from the mysterious duo. She attempts to attack them with her signature wind blade magic, but their power proves too great, causing her sword to shatter instantly.

Kamui steps forward confidently, determined to face the enemies head-on. He brandishes his divine shield and magic sword, ready to engage in battle with the formidable foes.

The massive man releases an enormous burst of magical energy, freezing Kamui and Kaltovich in place. The skeleton then exudes a hauntingly eerie presence that leaves the party paralyzed with fear.

Kamui struggles to maintain his footing against the overwhelming force, his shield unable to withstand the sheer power of the attack. He is thrown backward, crashing into a boulder and sustaining severe injuries.
