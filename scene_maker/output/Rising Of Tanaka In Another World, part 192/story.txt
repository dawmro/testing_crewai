Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 192.

The chapter opens with Karin, the Imperial Princess, who has been knocked down but is beginning to regain consciousness. Tanaka notices her disheveled state and becomes concerned for her well-being.

Tanaka approaches Karin and offers his support, emphasizing that he will fight for her. He reassures her that the people of the Empire are united by her noble figure, which is a source of strength for them.

Ganash, the powerful warrior, confronts Tanaka with an air of arrogance and disdain. He mocks Tanaka's lack of skill and decides to use him as a tool to showcase his own power.

Despite Ganash's overwhelming presence and speed, Tanaka manages to evade his attacks with ease, leaving everyone in awe. Ganash becomes increasingly frustrated as he realizes the futility of his efforts against Tanaka.

Ganash, desperate for victory, unleashes a powerful flame attack. However, Tanaka's demon formations, including the newly acquired 'Great Sins Quartet Annihilation Formation', block and neutralize the flames, leaving Ganash stunned.

The chapter concludes with Ganash realizing the true extent of Tanaka's power and skill. Tanaka, ever the strategist, uses this moment to his advantage, ensuring Karin's safety and securing a victory that will be remembered for generations.
