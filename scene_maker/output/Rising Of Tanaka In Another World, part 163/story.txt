Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 163.

Echigoya sits in his spacious guild office, surrounded by documents. He carefully reviews a report compiled by Omoi regarding crop expectations and agricultural plans for the town. Echigoya's focus is unwavering as he absorbs the detailed information.

After reuniting with Tanaka, Omoi conducts an inspection of the agriculture land. He discovers that the soil, influenced by Tanaka's magic, contains excessive magical energy, leading to poor germination rates in the crops.

Omoi dedicates the next day to creating a magic tool designed to absorb excess magical energy from the soil. The process is aided by an artificial magic crystal manufacturing tool he had previously invented, allowing for rapid completion of the new tool.

The following day, Tanaka and Suke-san are seen flying over the agriculture land, using the newly created magic tools to address the soil's magical energy issues. Their actions demonstrate a seamless collaboration between Omoi’s intellect and Tanaka’s hands-on approach.

After successfully adjusting the soil and sowing new seeds, the team confirms optimal germination rates for the crops. Echigoya, impressed by their work, considers appointing Tanaka as the town's new leader but is surprised when Tanaka objects, humorously requesting they pretend a previous idea never happened.

Echigoya’s frustration reaches its peak as Tanaka insists on avoiding the title of 'star who advances the era a hundred years ahead.' Omoi’s indifferent reaction to this suggestion further annoys Echigoya, who manages to hold back his retorts but appears close to collapsing from stress.

Echigoya confronts Tanaka about the sudden change in his ambitions. Tanaka responds with a mix of humor and seriousness, emphasizing his role as a man of conviction despite the challenges he faces. His unique personality shines through as he asserts his determination to tackle internal affairs head-on.
