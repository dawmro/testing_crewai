Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 22.

Tanaka is in an inn, perusing a magic book. He contemplates learning fire, ice, wind, or stone ball spells. Ultimately, he decides to contract Stone Ball for its physical impact against enemies.

Tanaka learns healing and recovery magic at the basic level, recognizing their importance for his safety in this new world.

Tanaka visits a hot spring resort devastated by a dragon attack. He uses his healing magic on an injured old man and leaves some food as a reward, all while remaining elusive about his identity.

As Tanaka continues to heal the injured at the resort, he attracts attention. A child addresses him, prompting Tanaka to avoid revealing his true identity and quickly move on.

Rumors spread about a mysterious figure resembling a god who heals the injured. The figure is linked to the mountain ranges, where a miracle reportedly occurred. The guild in Nishi town assists with reconstruction efforts.
