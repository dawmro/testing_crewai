Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 198.

Ganash watches from a distance as Torte and Ã‰clair confront Morinaga's apostles, criticizing their reckless behavior. Ganash later stands up, determined to fight alongside the heroes.

Torte accuses Ganash of being condescending and questions his motives. She reveals that they must rely on the heroes to prevent Morinaga's destruction of the demon race, despite the uncertainty.

Ganash transforms into a sword to fight Morinaga, while Yashichi and Mikoto prepare for the God of Creation's power. The battle begins with the heroes facing Morinaga's apostles, showcasing their overwhelming speed and firepower.

Morinaga finally moves, exerting immense pressure that causes Princess Lala to be swallowed by a light dragon. Her transformation into a powerful figure with twelve wings leaves the heroes in awe but also worried about the growing threat.

Morinaga's overwhelming power threatens to destroy the land, but Tanaka appears to intervene. Despite his poor health and the chaos around him, Tanaka is determined to see the heroes through this challenge, much like a main character in a sports manga.
