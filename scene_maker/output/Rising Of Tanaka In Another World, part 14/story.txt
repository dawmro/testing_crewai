Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 14.

Tanaka stands atop a mountain, confidently practicing ignition magic. A massive flame erupts from his fingertip, displaying tremendous power and azure light, resembling a giant sword.

He attempts water magic, summoning a body of water that falls to the ground. Despite the comical situation, Tanaka remains focused, using a bucket to contain some water despite getting wet.

Tanaka concludes his training with an impressive spell: 'O all-destroying blue flames sealed in me.' A powerful pillar of light emerges, clearing the clouds and captivating the surrounding area. Monsters watch in awe as he departs.

The phenomenon draws attention in Morimori City, where citizens interpret it as a sign from a mountain god. The city begins to worship the mysterious entity, unaware of Tanaka's role in the events.
