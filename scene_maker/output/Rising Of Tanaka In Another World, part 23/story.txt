Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 23.

Tanaka sits in a private room of the guild, engaging in casual conversation with Echigoya. Echigoya reveals his suspicion about Tanaka's true abilities and warns him to keep a low profile.

Tanaka visits a diner-cum-tavern in Nishi town, where he overhears rumors about a God-like figure appearing at the hot springs resort. He discusses the situation with the tavern old man and expresses skepticism about defeating a dragon.

Tanaka encounters Homura, a red-haired woman leading a dragon-slaying team. After a brief introduction, Homura invites Tanaka to join her team, recognizing the potential assistance he could provide.
