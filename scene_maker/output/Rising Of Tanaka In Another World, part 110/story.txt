Tanaka feels his power surge as he stands victorious, only to witness Yashichi and Toby collapse mysteriously. The atmosphere shifts as General Red's maniacal laughter echoes, revealing a sinister plot.

General Red taunts Tanaka with boasts of his strategic prowess, confessing a deep-seated hatred for General White. He mocks Tanaka's friendship with the deceased hero and unveils a personal vendetta.

As General Red's soldiers close in, mysterious stone walls activate, ensnaring Yashichi, Toby, and Tanaka. The trio struggles against an unseen force, their strength waning as the trap tightens.

Tanaka recalls the smile of a tavern old man, linking him to General White's past. His memories flash as he taps into immense magical energy, determined to break free and avenge his friend.

General Red's maniacal laughter fills the air as explosions erupt, shattering the stone walls. Soldiers are blasted away, and dust engulfs the battlefield, signaling Tanaka's moment of reckoning.

Tanaka, radiating concentrated magical energy, confronts General Red with a steely gaze. He channels his power to create an escape route, using 'Embankment' magic to carve a path through the arena.

Yashichi and Toby escape, leaving Tanaka behind to face General Red alone. Their parting words hint at reunions and promises unfulfilled, as Tanaka's resolve hardens for the final battle.
