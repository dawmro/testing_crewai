Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 94.

The Phantom beasts attack Team Tanaka with ferocity. Suke-san charges forward, yelling 'First arrow – Ain!' His enhanced speed and illusion magic create an army of Grim Reapers, overwhelming the enemy and buying time for the team to set up their next move.

Kaku-san unleashes his grand magic in a multicolored explosion of rainbows. Using Neo Muscle Rainbow, he rains down powerful attacks on the remaining Phantom beasts. The combination of fire, ice, earth, and wind魔法 tears through the enemy, showcasing Kaku's obsession with power and precision.

As the battle reaches its climax, Tanaka soars into the sky, declaring 'The last arrow – Final!' He activates his Absolute Overdrive Zero Formula, a technique that manipulates airflow on a molecular level. The resulting shockwave disintegrates the remaining Phantom beasts, leaving Team Tanaka victorious.

Tanaka laughs triumphantly in the sky, his confidence radiating. Suke-san and Kaku-san look up at him with pride, knowing their combined efforts have proven successful. Despite their challenges, they are united and ready to face whatever comes next.
