Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 171.

Tanaka arrives in Oedo Imperial Capital, overwhelmed by its size and bustling crowd. He mutters to himself about the city's liveliness but hides his anxiety behind a facade of confidence.

Tanaka encounters a merchant who bumps into him, forcing Tanaka to act like a 'little man' to avoid drawing attention. He then scolds himself for being too cautious.

A mother figure confronts Tanaka for standing in the middle of the road, humiliating him publicly. Tanaka retreats to the side, muttering about his chuunibyou tendencies.

Tanaka approaches a guard to inquire about the Imperial Tournament Festival and the city's taverns. The guard educates him on the festival's significance and the role of the Guardian of the Empire.

Tanaka becomes fascinated by the idea of participating in the Imperial Tournament Festival, imagining himself as a future 'Guardian of the Empire.' He confidently declares his intention to join despite the guard's warnings.

Upon reaching the tournament's reception, Tanaka discovers that the entry deadline has passed. He collapses in defeat, realizing the extent of his miscalculations and missed opportunities.
