Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 6.

Tanaka discovers the mysterious phenomenon of item boxes, where objects disappear when imagined. He excitedly experiments with storing and retrieving clothes while the General watches him closely.

The General provides Tanaka with a short sword, belt, and a peculiar scent bag. Tanaka is intrigued by the sword but cautious of the scent bag's strange odor. The General explains its purpose as a monster repellent.

Tanaka humorously contemplates becoming a merchant but is quickly discouraged by the General, who warns him about the dangers of being a merchant and the limited storage capacity of item boxes. The conversation turns serious as the General explains the harsh realities of the world.

The General urges Tanaka to leave immediately due to increasing chaos in the capital and the failure of magic tools. Despite his reluctance, Tanaka agrees, and they escape together under the cover of darkness, facing the uncertainty ahead.

Outside the capital, Tanaka reflects on his journey with gratitude towards the General. They share a heartfelt farewell, with the General teasing him about future reunions. The scene ends with the General being imprisoned in the future and madness spreading, but for now, Tanaka embarks on his adventure alone.
