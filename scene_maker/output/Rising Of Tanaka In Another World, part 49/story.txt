Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 49.

Cassius, defeated and mad, mocks Brutus for her lackluster performance. His soldiers watch in silent resignation as he turns his attention to Princess Aisa.

Cassius taunts Princess Aisa about the guilt of killing her siblings and parents, causing her immense emotional pain and leading her to consider suicide.

Shosa and Taisa plead with their sister to stop, but are blocked by a barrier. Cassius watches gleefully, offering the knife as a 'solution' to Aisa's pain.

Princess Aisa, overwhelmed with guilt, takes the knife and prepares to kill herself, while Shosa and Taisa scream in horror.

Tanaka, unnoticed by everyone, rushes forward and uses healing magic to save Princess Aisa from her fatal wound, shocking everyone present.

Cassius confronts Tanaka in disbelief, questioning his power. Tanaka responds with arrogant confidence, declaring his intentions to challenge authority and 'take that seat' if needed.

Cassius mocks Tanaka's ambitions but secretly fears him. He escapes using a teleportation tool, leaving the scene with a sinister laugh.

The Alliance army resumes their march, reaching Gokuri City where Princess Aisa is tended to by Tanaka, who reflects on his actions and hopes for Suke-san and Kaku-san's safety.
