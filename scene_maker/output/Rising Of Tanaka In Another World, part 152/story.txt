Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 152.

Tanaka stands confidently in the face of All Biter's overwhelming magic attacks. Using live-support magic, he gains control of the air and analyzes each incoming attack with precision. He then unleashes his secret technique, Army of Mirrors – Copycat Troopers, creating imitations that reflect all creation.

All Biter, realizing its attacks are being countered, unveils its trump card—a massive shrine of light. The magical energy emanating from the shrine is beyond comprehension, even for Merlin, Mankind's greatest magician. The pillar of light grows brighter, engulfing Tanaka and creating a hellish realm.

As the shrine of light shatters, All Biter reveals its作弊 ability—a plunder-type ability that absorbs magical energy, knowledge, and skills. Despite the fearsome power, Tanaka remains unfazed. He recognizes the ability's weakness and confidently declares his victory, having seen through the cheat.
