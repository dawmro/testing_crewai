Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 117.

Team Tanaka arrives at the White Wolf Tribe village and finds it in a state of disrepair. The buildings are destroyed, fields are trampled, and the village is eerily silent.

Tanaka questions Black Mikeneko about the destruction and learns about the Purin Kingdom's greedy attempts to seize the mountain's resources.

Black Mikeneko explains how the White Wolf Tribe protected the sacred mountain, only to be overwhelmed by the kingdom army. The team recalls their past battles and encounters with supernatural beings.

The story reveals the appearance of a divinely beautiful figure on the sacred mountain, who clashes with the White Wolf Tribe's guardian spirit. This event marks the beginning of their troubles.

Tanaka warns his companions about 'All Biter,' an evolved enemy they encountered before. He expresses concern about facing it again, as its power is beyond their current capabilities.

Suke-san and Kaku-san are astonished by Tanaka's revelation but eventually believe him. Black Mikeneko resumes storytelling, hinting at the ominous events to come.
