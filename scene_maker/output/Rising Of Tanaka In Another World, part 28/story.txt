Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 28.

Tanaka is relaxing in the tavern when Homura arrives, looking ready to depart. Their brief conversation reveals her realization of her own powerlessness and her determination to retrain.

After Homura leaves, Tanaka jokes about her falling for him, showing his characteristic self-deprecating humor. The tavern old man exasperatedly points out how unaware she is of his E-ranked status.

Tanaka heads to the guild and encounters Echigoya, who thanks him for his help and热情邀请他一同前往北方边疆。Despite initial hesitation, Tanaka agrees to join, driven by curiosity and his good rapport with Echigoya.

Echigoya's enthusiasm is contagious, and Tanaka, ever the adventurer, decides to embrace this new opportunity. They part ways as they prepare for their journey north, where exciting challenges await.
