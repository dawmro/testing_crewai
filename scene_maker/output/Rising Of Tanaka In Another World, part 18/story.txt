Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 18.

Tanaka accidentally invokes a powerful flame out of reflex while defending himself from three aggressive men. He manages to suppress the magic, preventing widespread destruction but leaving the attackers dead.

Tanaka, faced with the corpses of the three men, questions their identities and the legality of his actions in this new world. He contemplates whether they were bandits or victims of a monster.

Determined to take action, Tanaka decides to investigate further. He takes one of the swords as a memento and vows to avenge the victims, imagining them as innocent warriors killed by an unseen monster.

Echigoya, a merchant, arrives at the scene after Tanaka has left. He examines the corpses and reflects on the mysterious nature of Tanaka's fighting style, suspecting deeper complications in this world.

Echigoya concludes his investigation and continues his journey to Fugu town, where he reunites with other guild members. He hints at the strange occurrences surrounding Tanaka's actions but chooses to ignore them for now.

The story concludes as Echigoya safely arrives in Fugu town and resumes his trading activities. The incident involving Tanaka remains unresolved, leaving hints of larger disturbances in the world.
