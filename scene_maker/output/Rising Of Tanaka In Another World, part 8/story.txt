Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 8.

Tanaka encounters a horned rabbit monster while traveling in the mountains. Despite his low battle power, he manages to defeat it by reflexes, gaining 9/100 experience points.

After defeating the monster, Tanaka inspects his personal information and decides to level up by staying in the remote mountain ranges. He plans to hunt rabbits for two weeks to gain more experience.

Tanaka spends two weeks hunting rabbits, accumulating a total of 778 kills. Despite his efforts, he notices minimal improvement in his stats and becomes frustrated. His sword skill also stalls midway through the process.

Feeling the need for new information and resources, Tanaka decides to resume his journey towards the Haru Empire. He reflects on his experiences and the challenges ahead, including the possibility of facing powerful enemies to further level up.
