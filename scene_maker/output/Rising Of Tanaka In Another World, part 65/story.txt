Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 65.

Tanaka and his team traverse the desolate wastelands of the Purin Kingdom, struggling with the intense heat and dry environment. Their spirits are tested as they push forward despite the harsh conditions.

Exhausted by the sweltering heat, Tanaka expresses frustration about their journey, while Kaku-san and Suke-san arrogantly boast about their resistance to the heat, further agitating Tanaka.

Tanaka decides they need a break and pulls out ice from his item box. Finding it dried up, he uses magic to conjure a gigantic chunk of ice and levitates it in the air.

Suke-san uses wind blade magic to break the ice into smaller blocks. Tanaka gratefully eats some ice while storing the rest, showing camaraderie with Suke-san despite their hardships.

Kaku-san comments on the absurdity of their magic usage and redirects the conversation to their training. Tanaka agrees, and they proceed with their daily regimen despite their low spirits.

Under Kaku-san's guidance, Tanaka trains in Grand Magic, a high-level skill typically reserved for gods or heroes. Despite his lack of formal training, Tanaka effortlessly draws and controls large amounts of magical energy.
