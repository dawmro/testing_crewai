Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 158.

The scene opens on a desolate, windswept landscape. The sky is darkened by swirling sandstorms, casting an eerie glow over the barren land. A group of ten robed figures, their faces hidden except for glowing red eyes, stands vigilantly in the storm.

Winged beings with black wings descend gracefully through the storm. Despite the chaos around them, they move with ease, their wings acting as natural magic tools. They approach the demon group and bow respectfully to their leader.

The winged individuals present a mysterious box to the demon leader. The box is ancient and sturdy, holding a cursed sword known as Bundam. As it is opened, a surge of magical energy fills the air, mesmerizing those who witness its power.

The leader of the demons realizes the sword's divine seal and the threat it poses if unleashed. The winged person explains that Morinaga, a god, sealed the sword to prevent its power from being used against humanity. However, the sword still holds traces of her divine energy.

The demons discuss their ambitious plan to break the seal and use the sword's power to overthrow the gods. The leader expresses confidence in their cause, seeing this as a sign from the world that the demon era is about to rise again. They disappear into the storm, leaving behind ripples of danger.
