Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 107.

Tanaka finds himself in confusion after being summoned to another world. He is confronted by Toby, who urges him to take action against Dlimes using both physical and magical attacks.

Dlimes approach Tanaka aggressively, taunting him with their superior wisdom. Tanaka's chuunibyou (疯帽子综合症) goes out of control as he prepares to defend himself.

Tanaka adopts a Karate stance, declaring his invincible defense technique 'Calamity End Vortex of Death Execution – Kakakasacchuuzai.' The Warden Muchisuki mocks him but soon realizes the seriousness of the situation.

The Warden Muchisuki underestimates Tanaka and his pets, leading to a sudden attack by Dlimes. Tanaka, seizing the moment, uses an enormous hole magic to trap them, showcasing his clever strategy.

After defeating the Warden Muchisuki's pets, Tanaka coolly explains that their main goal is escape, not victory. He strikes a pose with his fearless smile, leaving the Warden in awe of his cunning and power.
