Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 220.

The heroes bid farewell to the God of Creation and their comrades in Nanashi town. They stand before a shining transfer gate that leads them back to their homeworld.

Through the light of the divine gate, the heroes are transported back to their respective homes. Each hero is greeted by familiar sights and loved ones, marking the end of their extraordinary journey.

One hero reunites with his family, another faces wailing friends, while a third smiles at an unchanged hometown. Their individual stories of returning home are depicted in warm and emotional scenes.

Tanaka awakens in a pile of garbage near a town, confused about his surroundings. He mutters to himself about fatigue from his salaryman life and dusts off his suit, unaware of the fantastical adventure he once had.

As Tanaka walks home, memories of being summoned to another world, gaining power, and becoming a hero resurface. He nostalgically recalls his journey, ending with him disappearing into the crowd while talking to himself about his bizarre experiences.
