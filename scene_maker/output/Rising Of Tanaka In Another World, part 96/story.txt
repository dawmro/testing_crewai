Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 96.

The Purin Kingdom performs a risky summoning ritual during an inopportune time, allowing Kyou's avatar to enter the world. The land shakes as energy destabilizes, marking the beginning of the end.

Beatrice, the witch of the abyss, senses Kyou's presence and attempts to seal his avatar in the sealed land using barriers strengthened by the world's magical energy. Her efforts fail, leaving her trapped with the avatar in a dangerous predicament.

Tanaka, a bystander caught up in the summoning chaos, finds himself witness to the unfolding disaster. His mundane life is suddenly disrupted as he encounters Beatrice and learns of her mission to protect the world from Kyou's avatar.

Beatrice approaches Tanaka, explaining her situation and seeking his help in carrying forward her lineage's power. Despite his initial hesitation and doubts about his worthiness, Tanaka agrees to take on the responsibility.

Beatrice entrusts Tanaka with her powers, 'Creation and Destruction Boundary' and 'Deceiver of the Abyss.' Though he is surprised by the sudden shift in his role, Tanaka embraces his new destiny with enthusiasm, marking the beginning of his journey as a witch of the abyss.
