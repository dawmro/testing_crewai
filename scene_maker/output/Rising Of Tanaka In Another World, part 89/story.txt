Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 89.

Murgai bravely leaps into action to save Shijimi from soldiers, wielding only a large piece of wood. His bold move catches the attention of everyone present, but he is quickly overpowered by the soldiers.

The Baron propositions Murgai with a leadership role in exchange for his loyalty. Murgai refuses, determined to protect his loved ones and resist the Baron's manipulation, unaware of the true extent of the threat.

Murgai's valiant but hopeless battle comes to an end as soldiers impale him with lances. Shijimi rushes to his side, filled with desperation and regret, while the Baron orders the soldiers to execute them both.

As magic attacks are unleashed, an unexpected phenomenon occursâ€”a magical explosion that halts the attack. The dust clears to reveal Team Tanaka standing protectively over Murgai and Shijimi, radiating immense power and authority.

Tanaka steps forward, his hand glowing with magic. He uses his ability to heal Murgai's severe wounds, restoring him to full health. Tanaka delivers a harsh rebuke to the Baron and his soldiers, ordering his companions to eliminate them all.

Suke-san and Kaku-san move swiftly, annihilating the soldiers with ruthless efficiency. The scene ends with the destruction of the enemy forces, leaving the survivors stunned and defeated.
