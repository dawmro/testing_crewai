Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 143.

Tanaka encounters En’ou Zonmer for the first time. Initially overwhelmed by its majestic presence, he quickly realizes something feels off about its size.

Suke-san points out that Zonmer is unusually small for a being with such an impressive aura, sparking a discussion about appearances versus true power.

Zonmer reveals its true identity as a superior spirit, taunting Tanaka with its overpowering presence and challenging him to prove his worth.

Tanaka uses his secret technique—rubbing a silky fabric on his head—to temporarily boost his confidence, impressing Suke-san and Kaku-san with his ingenuity.

Tanaka cleverly navigates a tense standoff by proposing an alliance. He humbly begs En’ou Zonmer to assist them in clearing the mountain of monsters, showcasing his resourcefulness and charm.

Zonmer, intrigued by Tanaka’s proposal and sense of duty, agrees to join their cause, setting the stage for their journey together.
