Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 149.

Kamui dashes toward All Biter's legs while Tetsujin casts Ice Storm, freezing the tentacles and allowing Kamui to strike the giant leg.

The giant's fist chases Kamui, who narrowly escapes. Tetsujin provides support with arrows as All Biter loses balance due to Earth Shake.

Curryman slashes at the dragon tail but faces resistance. He retreats while using magic against advancing tentacles.

Mikoto's fire attack is ineffective, showing All Biter's immense defense. She and Merlin discuss their next move as the situation grows dire.

The trio chats about using Merlin's trump card, acknowledging its lack of style but necessity for victory.

Merlin casts Flame of the Fierce King, trapping All Biter in a closed space. The giant struggles to break free as the warriors watch.

Mikoto, urged by Merlin, unleashes her divine spell, delivering the final blow and defeating All Biter with overwhelming power.
