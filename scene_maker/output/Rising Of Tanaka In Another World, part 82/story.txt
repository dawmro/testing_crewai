Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 82.

Team Tanaka travels through a hilly forest area, hunting and moving eastward. They come across a horned tribe man named Murgai who aggressively confronts them, accusing them of trespassing.

Suke-san and Kaku-san quickly subdue Murgai, showcasing their teamwork and strength. Tanaka remains calm, maintaining his composure despite the situation.

A beautiful girl from the horned tribe appears, scolding Murgai for his actions. She introduces herself as Ruria and explains that her tribe had agreed to reconcile with humans but was shocked by Murgai's aggression.

Tanaka uses his charm to approach Ruria, introducing himself as Echigoya from the Haru Empire. He smoothly navigates the conversation, ensuring a peaceful resolution and leaving a positive impression on Ruria.
