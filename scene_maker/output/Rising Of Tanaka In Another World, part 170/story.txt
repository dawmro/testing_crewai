Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 170.

Tanaka is seen struggling to recreate the feeling of his previous battle with the Part Timer Warrior. He is frustrated as he tries to master the Grand Magic 'Harem Creation', a technique he believes will help him achieve his goal of creating a harem.

Tanaka expresses his determination to create a harem, imagining the success of Echigoya's invitations to beautiful women across the Empire. He calculates the odds and plans to ride the momentum to achieve his goal with confidence.

Despite his high hopes, Tanaka faces limitations in using Grand Magic. He decides to focus on training alone, considering the dangers of acting without support and the potential risks of being noticed by powerful individuals in Nanashi town.

Tanaka contemplates his strategy for battle, acknowledging the vulnerabilities of his team's magic-based approach. He recalls past strategies and the importance of having a trump card to counter potential magic reflection or anti-magic measures.

Tanaka reveals his WIP secret sorcery technique, the Great Sins Triad Annihilation Formation. Borrowing power from three archdevils of hell, he aims to create a fearsome attack that is impervious to magic reflection.

In the bustling streets of Oedo Imperial Capital, Hero Yashichi and Toby arrive. They discuss Toby's past as a merchant and his recent guild debut, while also acknowledging the risks of being in the Empire after the Kingdom incident.

Yashichi and Toby spot an eerie pale-skinned man with a magnificent sword in the crowd. The man's presence alarms them, but he soon disappears without any confrontation, leaving them to wonder about his identity and intentions.

As Yashichi and Toby continue their sightseeing, they express cautious hopes for avoiding trouble in the Imperial Capital. The encounter with the mysterious man lingers in their minds as they prepare for potential challenges ahead.
