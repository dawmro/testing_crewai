Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 210.

Tanaka arrives at Nanashi town and realizes he doesn't belong there. He muses about the old man's mysterious nature but decides to follow his instructions.

The tavern old man, revealed as a God of Creation, scolds Tanaka for his jokes and quickly transports him through a door of light to a new location.

Tanaka finds himself in a pure white world, far from the previous location. The old man explains it's a special training space, but Tanaka feels something is off about the place.

Ignoring the old man's anger, Tanaka transforms the stark white environment into a more habitable one using his skills, impressing the old man with his progress.

The tavern old man reveals the universe's historyâ€”countless stars and lives destroyed in a past battle. He pleads for Tanaka to help create a stronger barrier to prevent further destruction.
