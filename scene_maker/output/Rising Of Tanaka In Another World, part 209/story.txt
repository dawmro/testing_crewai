Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 209.

The chapter opens with the restoration of the arena in Oedo, the Imperial Capital, following a historical incident. The ceremonial hall is bustling with spectators as they watch the unveiling of the new Guardian of the Empire.

Imperial Princess Karin appears before the crowd, dressed in her formal attire. Her presence and pure demeanor elicit cheers from the audience, marking a symbolic shift for the empire following the recent chaos.

The emperor, Vinta Haru XIV, stands alongside his daughter Karin as they address the nation. The empire announces the general outline of the recent incident but keeps the Purin Kingdom's conspiracy hidden from the public to maintain peace and cooperation.

Tanaka, having witnessed the ceremonial proceedings, decides to leave the arena quietly. His departure is met with curiosity and a farewell message from Echigoya, his self-proclaimed best friend, who offers him tempting deals to stay.

Tanaka declines Echigoya's offer, stating his aversion to power struggles. His refusal shocks Echigoya, but Karin and her father acknowledge Tanaka's unique character and the important mission he likely carries.

After leaving the arena, Tanaka encounters the God of Creation, who informs him of an emergency requiring his attention. This new development forces Tanaka to abandon plans for a carefree night, much to his frustration.
