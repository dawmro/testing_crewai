The Imperial Tournament Festival concludes with chaos in the arena as Toby faces his final match against Karin. Despite his best efforts, Toby collapses, leaving the audience in shock and Tanaka distraught.

Tanaka passionately cheers for Toby, shouting emotional pleas for him to keep fighting. His shouts are heard by Mikoto and Yashichi, who discuss Toby's surprising strength and resourcefulness throughout the tournament.

Mikoto and Yashichi reflect on Toby's journey, acknowledging his quick wit and determination despite being a merchant with limited combat experience. The Knight of Roses and Nikumen also observe the scene, adding depth to the moment.

The ceremony for Karin's ascension as the new 'Guardian of the Empire' begins. Vinta Haru XIV, the mild-mannered emperor, overlooks the event in the ceremonial hall, while Tanaka rushes to the bathroom, missing the critical moment.
