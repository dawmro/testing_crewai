Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 15.

Tanaka effortlessly defeats a giant caterpillar with a swift sword swing, showcasing his casual yet effective monster-hunting approach. He stores the carcass in his item box and continues his search for prey.

Upon returning to Hazama town after a day of hunting, Tanaka interacts with Jody at the guild counter. He efficiently matches monster kills with E-ranked subjugation requests, highlighting his unique and efficient method.

Tanaka learns about bandit attacks terrorizing the town from Hachi and Kuma. Despite the severity of the situation, Tanaka remains detached, focusing on his monster-hunting routine while others express concern about potential dangers.

The conversation turns serious as Hachi reveals that even higher-ranked guild members might be unable to stop the bandits. Tanaka realizes the potential threat this poses, hinting at future challenges beyond his usual monster-hunting.
