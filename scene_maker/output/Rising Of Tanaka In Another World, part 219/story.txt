Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 219.

Tanaka confronts the God of Destruction, who is overwhelmed by his own power. The God of Destruction's will to destroy is gradually eroded as Tanaka engages him in conversation.

Tanaka uses the enormous energy from the defeated God of Destruction to resurrect the destroyed worlds and their respective Gods, restoring order and life to those regions.

Morinaga, trapped in a crystal seal, is freed by Tanaka. He elevates her to the status of a God, allowing her to govern the world once controlled by the God of Destruction as a form of revenge.

Morinaga expresses gratitude towards Tanaka for his actions and disappears into the new world she is tasked with governing. Tanaka reflects on his journey, acknowledging the toll it has taken on him.

Tanaka, having exhausted his strength through sublimation to a higher dimension, fades away from the world of darkness. His final words hint at his acceptance of the inevitable end to his journey.

The aftermath of Tanaka's sacrifice is shown as Mikoto and Zonmer celebrate their victory over the God of Destruction, while Kaku-san and Suke-san silently mourn the loss of their comrade who saved them all.
