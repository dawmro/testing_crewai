Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 70.

The scene opens with a plump slave trader and his armed men attempting to take the sister of Kanabun, a young beastman boy. The tension rises as the group prepares to overpower them.

Kanabun courageously stands up to the slave traders, shouting for help and refusing to let his sister be taken. His sister rushes to protect him, but the slave trader orders both siblings to be taken away.

Tanaka steps in unexpectedly, confronting the slave trader and calling out his unjust actions. The trader mocks Tanaka's intervention, leading to a standoff between them.

The leader of the armed men orders Tanaka to be attacked, but Tanaka cleverly delays the fight by taunting him and analyzing the situation. He realizes he must avoid direct confrontation due to the beastmen's hesitation.

With a dramatic flair, Tanaka activates his secret technique, 'Cocytus Tears,' summoning a massive ice lump that engulfs the slave traders and their men. The scene ends with the group defeated, showcasing Tanaka's strategic use of magic.
