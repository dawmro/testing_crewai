Rising Of Tanaka In Another World, part 121.

Tanaka arrives at the sacred mountain of Chocoboro, seeking peace and new opportunities in this magical land. He encounters an old man who recognizes his potential and offers to teach him magic.

The Purin Kingdom dispatches a battalion to clear the area around Chocoboro. The soldiers, confident in their strength, set up camp and relax under the watch of accompanying priests. Unbeknownst to them, danger lurks.

As dusk falls, an eerie silence descends upon the military base. A powerful explosion engulfs the area, obliterating the battalion and leaving only a massive pillar of light in its wake. The patrol squad witnesses this apocalyptic scene but cannot comprehend its origins.

The upper echelons of the Purin Kingdom are alerted to the disaster. Fearing the worst, they mobilize their forces and prepare for an impending threat, with rumors spreading throughout the kingdom of the Demon Lord's emergence.
