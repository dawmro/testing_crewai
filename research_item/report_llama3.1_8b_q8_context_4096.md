===========================================================

## Introduction
------------

As a Comparative Reporting Analyst, I have compiled research information from Serper, Tavily Search, and Reddit Search to generate a comprehensive comparison report on the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Garmin Fenix 9. This report aims to support the goal of finding the best health wearable for 2024 for training for a marathon.

## Research Findings
-----------------

### Serper Search

* **Apple Watch Ultra 2**: Offers advanced fitness tracking features, including GPS, heart rate monitoring, and water resistance up to 100m.
* **Garmin Fenix 9**: Provides more extensive fitness tracking capabilities, including stress tracking, sleep monitoring, and customizable watch faces.

### Tavily Search

* **Training Plans**: Garmin provides pre-built training plans for marathons on its website and through the Garmin Connect Mobile app. These plans can be imported into the Fenix 9 and adjusted according to individual needs.
* **Garmin Coach**: This feature offers personalized coaching based on your fitness level, goals, and schedule preferences. It includes adaptive training plans that adjust to your progress over time.

### Reddit Search

* **Comparison with Apple Watch**: While both devices offer various features for marathon training, it's essential to note that the Training Load feature on Apple Watch is not directly comparable to Garmin's Daily Suggested Workouts (DSW) or adaptive training plans.
* **Best Practices for Marathon Training with Fenix 9**:
	+ Import a pre-built training plan from Garmin Connect Mobile app.
	+ Utilize Garmin Coach for personalized coaching and adaptive training plans.
	+ Pay attention to Daily Suggested Workouts (DSW) but do not rely solely on it; instead, use it as a guide and listen to your body's signals.

## Final Recommendation
---------------------

Based on the research findings from Serper, Tavily Search, and Reddit Search, I recommend the Garmin Fenix 9 for runners who prioritize advanced fitness tracking features and personalized coaching. The Fenix 9 offers more extensive training plans and adaptive coaching capabilities compared to the Apple Watch Ultra 2.

However, if you're looking for a more stylish watch with excellent water resistance, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is an excellent choice.
