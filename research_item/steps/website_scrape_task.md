Tom's Hardware Verdict
If the GeForce RTX 3060 can come close to its official $329 asking price, it's a great product for mainstream gamers. But in today's market, even with reduced mining performance, that's an unlikely if, as its performance lands right between the RTX 2060 Super and 2070 Super.

## AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT Review
The Radeon RX 6700 XT delivers good performance, and the official price looks reasonable. It's doubtful AMD will meet the demand at launch, but long-term this should prove a competitive offering in the GPU market.
