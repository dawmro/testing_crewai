Based on the search results, both the RTX 3060 12GB and the RX 6700 XT 12GB have their strengths and weaknesses. The RTX 3060 is suitable for most games at high settings and can even handle some games at 1440p medium settings. However, it has higher power consumption than the RX 6700 XT.

On the other hand, the RX 6700 XT is faster and more expensive than the RTX 3060, but it has better aggregate performance score, memory size, and power efficiency. However, it also has lower pixel rate and texture fillrate compared to the RTX 3060.

Therefore, the final answer to the original question of "Find the best GPU for both gaming and machine learning" is that both GPUs have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice depends on individual needs and preferences.
